  one_sentence: Stablecoin that should stay at the value of 1 USD
  introduction: "Paxos Standard\u2122 is the world's first regulated crypto asset.\
    \ The Paxos Standard token is fully collateralized 1:1 by the U.S. dollar, issued\
    \ by the Paxos Trust Company, and approved and regulated by the New York State\
    \ Department of Financial Services."
  technology: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers the benefits of crypto-assets
    such as immutability and decentralized accounting. Since it is fully collateralized
    by dollars, Paxos Standard offers a liquid, digital alternative to cash that is
    available 24/7 for instantaneous transaction settlement and is fully redeemable.
    As a Trust company, Paxos is a fiduciary and qualified custodian of customer funds,
    and can therefore offer greater protections for customer assets than any other
    existing stablecoin. Dollar deposits used to purchase PAX from Paxos.com are always
    held in segregated accounts at multiple FDIC-insured U.S.-domiciled banks.
  future: Verified Paxos customers can purchase and redeem tokens directly through
    Paxos.com on a 1:1 basis with USD. Paxos Standard has been designed as an Ethereum
    token written according to the ERC-20 protocol, so that anyone with an Ethereum
    wallet will be able to send and receive Paxos Standard tokens. The smart contract
    has been audited by smart contract auditors Nomic Labs and ChainSecurity, and
    nationally top-ranking auditing firm Withum will perform attestation procedures
    on our token and bank account balances on a month-end basis..
