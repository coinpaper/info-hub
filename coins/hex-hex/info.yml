  abstract: "HEX is an ERC20 token designed and launched by Richard Heart on 2 December\
    \ 2019 on the Ethereum network. HEX is designed to be a store of value to replace\
    \ the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product\
    \ used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off\
    \ the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within\
    \ the Ethereum network."

    scandals_highlights:
      description: 'HEX has been on a roller coaster ride ever since its advent. Interestingly, the ups 
      and downs of its journey have been happening side by side, which is quite interesting. The project 
      was quick enough to earn a notorious name for itself. It was seen as scam by many due to its founder 
      (Richard Heart) being a very controversial figure. Due to the dubious practices of the founder, HEX 
      is virtually not listed on any major exchange and not in the rankings either. 99% of the trading 
      volume takes place on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. 
      Even though the project was labeled a scam by many, it still managed to go big on the cryptocurrency 
      markets. It is approaching the $1 billion milestones in terms of market capitalization very quickly. 
      This development came in around May 2020, when the project had a reported market capitalization of 
      over $970 million. A sudden surge came when many whales were rumored to have staked a lot of money 
      in HEX tokens.'

    product:
      description: 'HEX is an ERC-20 token as an actual product. The blockchain technology is built such 
      that it will reward the holders of the token instead of the miners. The concept is very similar to 
      that of conventional certificates of deposit (CD). Users can lock their investments in HEX tokens, 
      and then can earn interest along with their principal amount, once the term matures.'

      however, are not very large in number and that is the primary reason why development has been

    partnerships:
      description: 'HEX has managed to form several key partnerships, even though it is being considered 
      a scam by a large part of the crypto-community. One of the most strategic partnerships under its 
      belt is the one with the Milan-based payments company, SIA group. HEX hopes that this partnership 
      will allow it to capture the existing bank clients by offering them a digital alternative. 
      In other news, HEX has also entered into a partnership with IBM, the leading IT giant. HEX will 
      be the official business partner for IBM for their new institutional custody solution for digital 
      assets. In return, HEX will be making use of IBM’s advanced data security and protection features 
      on their proprietary platform.'

      no notable project that talks about staking interest in depositing your coins. KuCoin, Elcoin, and
