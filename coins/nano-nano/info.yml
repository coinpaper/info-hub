whitepaper:
  abstract: Recently, high demand and limited scalability have increased the average
    transaction times and fees in popular cryptocurrencies, yielding an unsatisfactory
    experience. Here we introduce Nano, a cryptocurrency with a novel block-lattice
    architecture where each account has its own blockchain, delivering near instantaneous
    transaction speed and unlimited scalability.
