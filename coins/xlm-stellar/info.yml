  one_sentence: Global transactions with very low fees
  introduction: General Data and Information. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb (formerly
    of Ripple) and David Mazieres, Stellar is a decentralized open-source network
    for the exchange of over 500+ assets (including tokens and fiat) via the Stellar
    Consensus Protocol. As the global remittance market was worth nearly 600 billion
    US dollars in 2016 (with small cross border transactions attracting comparatively
    high fees and slow service), easing the friction on these remittance payments
    would help Stellar capture a significant share of this underserved and antiquated
    market. In the Stellar network, users make payments (in any acceptable currency,
    fiat, gold, XLM) with other users, with the debts between trusted users being
    recorded on the decentralized ledger. When the payments are finalized the balance
    of the users are recorded upon the ledger.
  technology: 31st July 2014 - Stellar Network launched. Non-Profit Stellar Development
    Foundation created to assist with development. 31st July 2014 - 3 million USD
    in seed funding from Stripe. August 2014 - First exchange utilising Stellar Network
    (Mercado Bitcoin) annouced. November 2015 - New Consensus algorithm (SCP) goes
    live. May 2017 - Lightyear.io (for-profit arm of Stellar, now known as Interstellar)
    launched. Steptember 2017 - Stellar Partnership Grant Program announces grants
    for development on Stellar Network. Utility. Stellar Lumens (XLM) is the native
    currency of the Stellar blockchains and has several uses. The first use case is  as
    a token for establishing your account, it is a minimal amount (1 XLM), to prevent
    network spamming. The second use case is for payments to establish trustlines
    from one payment node (account) to another account. Payment fees (0.00001 XLM)
    are another use case for the native currency, and larger users will also be required
    to use Stellar Lumens to be able to issue assets on the Stellar blockchain. The
    last use of Stellar Lumens is as a bridging currency and liquidity provider between
    users and chains who have no common currency to complete exchanges.
  future: "As all the participants are transacting on the Stellar Network, XLM is\
    \ the common currency for the blockchain. Thus, any \u201Cmissing\u201D assets\
    \ required for a chain of exchanges can be substituted for the native Lumens.\
    \ Significant Features. Transactions are pseduo-anonymous. Funds are sent address\
    \ to address, but an owner identity can eventually attributed to an address given\
    \ enough data and analysis. Low energy usage and high network speed using Stellar\
    \ Consensus Protocol. Total Supply uncapped. Peer to peer currency exchanges,\
    \ tokens and fiat. All users are able to  issue tokens on the Stellar Network.\
    \ Open-source and highly decentralized. References: .."

      description: "Stellar (XLM) is a public distributed payment system that belongs\
        \ to the Stellar Development Foundation. The coin has retained its position\
        \ among the top ten most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The interesting\
        \ thing about the technology is that while other altcoins follow the prices\
        \ of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Stellar (XLM) often shows signs of growth.<br />\r\
        \nStellar\u2019s main vision is to establish a decentralized banking system.\
        \ It seeks to make its coin Stellar Lumens a global currency that would be\
        \ globally recognized and accepted which will result in its being used for\
        \ daily transactions. A user can pay a bank some fiat currency (e.g. USD,\
        \ Euro \u2026) and the receiver could collect the payment in another fiat\
        \ currency, in the same way, Stellar Lumen will be used as an intermediate\
        \ technology (Mazieres, 2019). The transaction will take much lesser time\
        \ and cut down heavily on the transaction charges as compared to conventional\
        \ banking (Applicature, 2018).<br />\r\nSince the network aims to provide\
        \ freedom in terms of currency dealing, it is essential that it should have\
        \ access to huge amounts of different fiat currency reserves. This would be\
        \ achieved by working hand in hand with banks. However, banks are not showing\
        \ interest in adopting the technology as they would lose a major portion of\
        \ their revenue stream, should they partner with the technology. "

        \ to be released on 1 December 2018. However, due to some undisclosed events,\
        \ the deadline was missed and there\u2019s no update regarding the project\
        \ lately (Stellar Development Foundation, 2018).<br />\r\nStellar team has\
        \ only distributed a mere 20% of all its Lumen coins among its users. It plans\
        \ on distributing the rest of the 80% in the next 10 years. However, not every\
        \ user will be getting the Stellar Lumens airdrops. Only those user accounts\
        \ who would have at least 0.05% of all votes would receive the distributed\
        \ amount. A large share of the cryptocurrency will be retained by the Stellar\
        \ team. When 20 Billion Lumens were distributed among bitcoin holders, only\
        \ 2 Billion Lumens were claimed and the Stellar Development Foundation took\
        \ the remaining 18 Billion Lumens."
