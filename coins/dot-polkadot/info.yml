  introduction: There are not many cryptocurrencies that have gained so much popularity in such a short span of time as Polkadot. Although the cryptocurrency has been around since past 3 years and was in its development phase for a better period of time, its main net launched recently in August 2020. Polkadot has taken the crypto-markets by storm with the rapid development. The upsurge in its popularity has enabled it to make its way into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capital in just a matter of 2 weeks.
  technology: Polkadot is sometimes dubbed as the mother of all cryptocurrencies, and is sometimes described as the Ethereum Killer. Although the founder of Polkadot has put it out openly that it is not a competitor to Ethereum, a closer look into the dynamics of the technology suggests otherwise.
  future: The technology that Polkadot has brought forward is indeed revolutionary; something which has the potential to change the dynamics of the whole cryptocurrency world.

whitepaper:
  abstract: Present-day blockchain architectures all suffer from a number
    of issues not least practical means of extensibility and scalability.
    We believe this stems from tying two very important parts of the consensus architecture,
    namely canonicality and validity, too closely together. This paper introduces an
    architecture, the heterogeneous multi-chain, which fundamentally sets the two apart.

  introduction:
    purpose:
      description: In the year 2017, there was a surge in the number of available cryptocurrencies as many experienced individuals realized the true potential of cryptocurrencies. As a result, many newer ambitious projects that focused their energies towards the development of a decentralised internet, also known as Web 3.0, came into the limelight. Polkadot is a similar project that seeks to power the future of a decentralised internet. The technology has identified the lack of inter-operation between different cryptocurrencies, and therefore has empowered its own blockchain to be interoperable with other blockchains regardless of whether it was within or outside the cryptocurrency. This is indeed one of the greatest powers of the Polkadot project.
        Polkadot also provides the relevant infrastructure and technology through its blockchain platform which allows for the creation of smart contracts and even new blockchains built on top of the Polkadot network. The Polkadot technology is built on a modular design and is upgradeable. The network of this futuristic technology is decentralised and is governed by those who hold DOT, the native token of the Polkadot cryptocurrency (Krupka, 2020).

    scandals_highlights:
      description: Polkadot organised its ICO in October 2017 on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The ICO for the DOT cryptocurrency was tremendously successful and managed to raise a huge amount of $145 million USD. During the ICO, 10 million DOTs were sold to the public which is essentially half the supply of the DOT cryptocurrency. Each DOT token was released at a price of $28.80 USD.
        The main scandal of the DOT history came in two weeks later when after the Parity Hack, about 2/3 of these funds were permanently frozen. The cyber-attackers exploited a weakness in the code of the Parity Wallet. Despite this huge loss, the founding team decided to carry on with the project. In order to overcome this loss, another private funding round was organised in 2019. This time, each DOT token was sold at $120 USD, raising a staggering figure of over 60 million USD.
        The team behind Polkadot delivered the highly anticipated project by launching its main net in August 2020. Soon after the launch, Polkadot price valuation soared up high, making it amongst the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capital.

    product:
      description: Polkadot is a revolutionary project whose main aim is to establish a more decentralised internet. As a matter of fact, it is backed by the Web3 Foundation, which is a Swiss-based organisation working actively to realise the dream of free and decentralised internet.
        The actual product is hard to describe in simple words. Polkadot is easily one of the most complicated cryptocurrencies of this era. To get a deep understanding of the technology, Polkadot Foundation has series of articles dedicated to explaining the technology. However, Polkadot can be visioned as an ecosystem of blockchains. The backbone of the project is the main blockchain known as Relay Chain. The Relay Chain can have Parachains growing out of it which can have their own tokens, protocols, methodologies and mechanisms (Platts, 2019).
