  one_sentence: Bitcoin copy with faster transaction times
  introduction: Bitcoin SV (BSV) started in November 2018 as a hard fork of Bitcoin
    Cash, which itself was a hard forked version of the original Bitcoin. BSV was
    one of two coins that emerged from the hard fork, with Bitcoin Cash ABC as the
    other coin created from the event.
  technology: Upon creation of Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin cash holders who had their private
    keys or kept their Bitcoins on a service that supported the split were able to
    receive equal amounts of Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash ABC, resulting in further
    divergence in Bitcoin price dynamics. The Bitcoin SV team said that its vision
    is to restore the Bitcoin protocol to its original design.
  future: Bitcoin SV also enables massive scaling, which its team says will pave the
    way for the BSV blockchain to support significantly higher transaction volumes
    and more transaction fees for miners. This is important for miners to maintain
    profitability as the block reward will halve again in the year 2020 (reducing
    from 12 BSV to 6.25 BSV for each block), and halve again in later years.Bitcoin

      description: "When the world of cryptocurrencies came into existence through\
        \ the birth of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto was the visionary who laid down the\
        \ mission of the technology in his whitepaper \u2018\u2019Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer\
        \ Electronic Cash System\u201D. As the technology evolved and many other cryptocurrencies\
        \ made their way into the crypto-world, the technology deviated greatly from\
        \ its main course. Bitcoin Blockchain has been broken down into smaller factions,\
        \ each offering its own version of the Bitcoin. Bitcoin encountered its first\
        \ hard fork on August 2017 and with it \u2018Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\u2019 rose\
        \ to stage. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was developed with the aim of solving the scalability\
        \ issue of technology and creating a more efficient replacement. Note that\
        \ Bitcoin Cash (BCH) did not(!) replace Bitcoin (BTC).<br />\r\nAfter some\
        \ time, the Bitcoin Cash community felt that the technology had deviated from\
        \ the Bitcoin Cash vision as defined in the whitepaper from the original Bitcoin\
        \ (BTC). Once the Bitcoin Cash fork happened, Bitcoin SV (BSV) (SV stands\
        \ for Satoshi Vision) and Bitcoin ABC (BCHABC) (ABC stands for Adjustable\
        \ Blocksize Cap) were born (SFOX, 2018). According to the official spokesperson,\
        \ Bitcoin SV is the restoration of the original technology. It aims to return\
        \ to the original plan and vision of Satoshi by working for a completely decentralized\
        \ network and using the cryptocurrency solely as a tool for payment and trade\
        \ exchange (ChangeNow, 2018).<br />\r\n"

    scandals_highlights:
      description: "Bitcoin SV\u2019s inception was marked both by a highlight and\
        \ a scandal for the technology. In August 2018, in trying to pursue the actualization\
        \ of nChain and Coin Geek, Bitcoin Cash forked and two separate communities\
        \ namely Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV came in to being. Bitcoin SV\u2019s leadership\
        \ and the community, on the whole, were hostile in their dealings as they\
        \ made repeated aggressive attempts to practically wipe out Bitcoin Cash\u2019\
        s supposedly deviated technology by taking all of its hashing power. The community\
        \ was adamant to compel Bitcoin\u2019s original community to accept the Satoshi\
        \ Vision by force. This crypto-civil-war went on for around a week before\
        \ both technologies decided that they had considerable representation in form\
        \ of their community and they should focus on sustaining that (SFOX, 2018).<br\
        \ />\r\nAnother major highlight for Bitcoin SV came in May 2019, when the\
        \ cryptocurrency surged more than 120 percent. This was partly due to the\
        \ rather surprising development as the founder, Craig White, succeeded in\
        \ \u2018proving\u2019 himself as the original Satoshi Nakamoto and registering\
        \ the Bitcoin white paper\u2019s copyrights to his name (Ouimet, 2019).<br\
