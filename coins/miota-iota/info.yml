  one_sentence: Machine to machine micro transactions
  introduction: "IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger protocol that goes 'beyond\
    \ blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless \u2018Tangle\u2019."
  technology: The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-proof Directed Acyclic Graph, with no fees
    on transactions & no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per
    second in the network. Instead, throughput grows in conjunction with activity
    in the network; the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike blockchain architecture,
    IOTA has no separation between users and validators; rather, validation is an
    intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization.
  future: IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the emerging Internet-of-Things
    (IoT)..

whitepaper:
  abstract: "In this paper we analyze the mathematical foundations of IOTA, a cryptocurrency\
    \ for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) industry. The main feature of this novel cryptocurrency\
    \ is the tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for storing transactions. The\
    \ tangle naturally succeeds the blockchain as its next evolutionary step, and\
    \ offers features that are required to establish a machineto-machine micropayment\
    \ system.<br />\r\n"

        \ Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, it uses distributed ledgers. This enables\

      description: "The actual goal of IOTA is to provide a seamless transaction which\
        \ is both faster and cheaper. In order to do this, IOTA has replaced the blockchain\
        \ technology with its own technology knows as Tangle (IOTA Foundation, 2018).\
        \ Tangle is a system of interlinked and individual transactions that are stored\
        \ across the decentralized network of users. When a transaction is initiated,\
        \ it needs to verify two previous random transactions, meaning each user plays\
        \ the role of a miner by processing the previous transactions. <br />\r\n\
        However, it is difficult to process transactions on a decentralized network\
        \ like Tangle, as the data that needs to be obtained comes from outside the\
        \ execution environment. To address this problem, IOTA has developed its own\
        \ protocol, known as Qubic, which provides the solution in the form of quorum\
        \ based computing (IOTA, 2018). In layman terms, Qubic offers support to the\
