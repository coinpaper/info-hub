      description: "There is a claim that the Chinese government supports the Blockchain\
        \ Company Onchain, and therefore its blockchain technology NEO (See, 2017).\
        \ However, it is hard to decide if one should be excited or worried about\
        \ this development. The Chinese government is notorious for seizing money\
        \ from their citizens and is therefore not completely a big plus for the company.\
        \ An example like this can be found from the likes of Baoshang Bank Co, where\
        \ the government assumed control of all its resources and assets in May 2019\
        \ (Bloomberg News, 2019).<br />\r\nUsually, cryptocurrencies are based on\
        \ such blockchain technologies which feature complete or partial decentralization.\
        \ However, NEO stands out in this aspect. It used a mining algorithm named\
        \ as \u201Cdelegated byzantine fault-tolerant\u201D which uses consensus nodes\
        \ to distribute the voting power. The company Onchain holds seven of such\
        \ nodes, keeping the control of the network with them and making NEO a centralized\
        \ cryptocurrency. Users are critical of this point, as Onchian can seize their\
        \ funds if the Chinese government tells them to do so (Manoppo, 2018).<br\
        \ />\r\nNEO Foundation has recently unlocked the NEO token worth $100 million\
        \ in May 2019. The revenues generated from these new tokens are planned to\
        \ be used for further development of the technology. However, this amount\
        \ of NEO tokens could be damaging if they are released into the market all\
        \ at once, as it might result in immediate inflation (G., 2019). <br />\r\n\
        In March 2019 the Neo Blockchain was down for over 2 hours, as block 3467252\
        \ took 127 minutes. This can happen with a single point of failure, as the\
        \ foundation is controlling 7 consensus nodes themselves.<br />\r\n"
