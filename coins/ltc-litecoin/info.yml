  one_sentence: Bitcoin copy with faster transaction times
  introduction: General Data and Information. The Litecoin software was released on
    the 7th October 2011 by Charlie Lee, with the network going live roughly a week
    later on the 13th of October 2011. As a fork of Bitcoin Core, Litecoin featured
    several improvements upon the original Bitcoin protocol including reduced blocktimes
    (decreased to 2.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes), increased total supply and a
    different proof of work algorithm (scrypt vs SHA-256). The adoption of a faster
    blocktime meant that transactions were quicker to settle and be written into the
    blockchain, whilst the adoption of the memory intensive scrypt algorithm was intended
    to defeat the ASIC dominance of mining (due to the added financial costs of producing
    specialized mining machines with the required extra memory). However, due to the
    popularity of Litecoin, ASICs have been already developed and deployed that are
    able to mine the scrypt algorithm.
  technology: 7th October 2011 - Open Source software for Litecoin released. 13th
    October 2011 - Litecoin network goes live. May 2017 - Segregated Witness (SegWit)
    implemented. First Lightning Network transaction completed on the Litecoin network.
    Utility. Litecoin serves a similar use-case function as Bitcoin, attempting to
    be a digital store of value and medium of exchange but with the advantage of faster
    block times (which makes transactions faster to settle). In addition (due to lower
    network usage), it has lower transaction fees than the better known flagship crypto-currency.
    However, it suffers from a smaller market capitalization and liquidity which makes
    it much less useful as a pairing partner for other crypto-currencies.
  future: 'Significant Features. - Average Blocktime of 2.5 minutes; Total supply
    of 84 million LTC; Proof of Work consensus based on scrypt algorithm. - Transactions
    are pseduo-anonymous. Funds are sent address to address, but an owner identity
    can eventually attributed to an address given enough data and analysis. - Whilst
    sharing many decentralized attributes of consensus and governance as Bitcoin,
    Litecoin does have a known creator who can provide vision and guidance for the
    direction of the project. - Decentralized access allowing any party with the open-source
    software and internet access to send and receive Bitcoin irreversibly without
    third party interference or trust. - Decentralized governance via open-source
    development and forking. References: ..'
