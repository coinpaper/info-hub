      up with a smart-contract based solution to lock digital asset as a collateral against some loan,
      without having to sell those assets.

      ETHLend was built on top of the Ethereum network to form an ecosystem secure lending in a simple
      peer-to-peer model. At the core of the protocol is the Smart Contract which records all the
      details related to the loan and also contains the address of the wallet where the collateral
      assets are stored. In case the borrower fails to return the loan, the collateral assets were
      simply transferred to the lender who then has the freedom to either keep it or sell it in open
      market'

    scandals_highlights:
      description: 'The origin of Aave started with ETHLend in 2017. Back then, it was a one of a
      kind project that has some very ambitious goals. ETHLend was built on top of the Ethereum network,
      and had a native ERC-20 token known as LEND. ETHLend held their ICO in November 2017 which gained
      considerable success. The ICO raised $16.2 million by selling almost 1 billion LEND tokens. Each
      token was priced at $0.0176. The release of the token was right in the middle of the crypto-bull
      run of 2017. Taking on the same trajectory, LEND soon reached an all-time-high of $0.44 in January
      2018.

      However, soon after the crypto-markets crashed, and LEND started on its journey of downfall. It
      remained well below its ICO price for the most of 2018 and 2019. In January 2020, ETHLend was
      rebranded and relaunched as Aave. The upgrade of Aave also brought many new features on the
      application platform and also enhanced the technology stack of the application with more advanced
      protocols. Aave quickly rallied a community around it and its popularity sky-rocketed. In just a
      matter of months, Aave managed to surpass $1 billion in market capitalization.'
