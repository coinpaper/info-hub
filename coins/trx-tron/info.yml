      description: "As the cryptocurrency craze continues to grow, and the \u2018\
        crypto-verse\u2019 expands unabatingly, with Bitcoin leading the crypto-race,\
        \ newer and sometimes cheaper, smaller and better alternatives have emerged\
        \ in the market. One of them is Tron (TRX), whose founder created the technology\
        \ with the sole intention of pursuing a dream of decentralized entertainment\
        \ industry at large while rendering the middle-party content providing platforms\
        \ like Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix, etc. insignificant. The technology\
        \ aims to build a decentralized platform that offers free, global, digital\
        \ content directly to the consumers (Seth, 2019).<br />\r\nTo put things into\
        \ perspective, what someone might say is an issue with the present-day entertainment\
        \ industry is that it runs the network of middle-men. When a user wants to\
        \ download an app, for example, he gets it through App Stores, or if a consumer\
        \ wants access to movies or series, he has to subscribe to content providing\
        \ platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime. This is exactly what Tron aims to\
        \ eliminate, by providing a digital platform where users can create, publish,\
        \ store and access their content while having full authority over their creation\
        \ (Tuwiner, 2018). The protocol strives to develop an ecosystem where the\
        \ creators can engage with the consumers directly by means of issuing and\
        \ trading the digital cryptocurrency Tron (The Analyst Team, 2018).<br />\r\

      description: "On June 25, 2018, Tron Foundation observed a major development\
        \ as they launched their own main-net. Tron was previously based on the Ethereum\
        \ Blockchain. This shift towards a Blockchain especially designed for Tron\
        \ by its developers is now celebrated as \u2018Tron Independence Day\u2019\
        \ among Tron\u2019s community (Holman, 2019).<br />\r\nTron has rapidly gained\
        \ popularity among the many different cryptocurrencies and currently, it has\
        \ persistently ranked in the top 10 cryptocurrencies on many exchanges. Tron\
        \ Foundation has transformed into a full-house development center since its\
        \ creation, housing around 400 employees as compared to only 10 at the time\
        \ of its inception. The team has committed a total of 22 updates to the Tron\
        \ protocol, more than that of Ethereum or EOS, indicating the regular and\
        \ fast development of the protocol (Masnavi, 2019). <br />\r\nTron Foundation,\
        \ in an exemplary turn of events, recently succeeded in acquiring BitTorrent.\
        \ This means that with its user-base of up to 100 million active users, Tron\
        \ has become the \u201Clargest decentralized Internet ecosystem in the world\u201D\
        . This is a major step towards the vision of a decentralized Internet and\
        \ Web 3.0 as defined by Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun (Holt, 2018).<br />\r\
        \nHowever, when everything is going in your and your technology\u2019s favor,\
        \ then the setbacks and scandal are just close by, waiting to strike. Tron\u2019\
        s price took a major hit when Justin Sun was accused of plagiarizing Tron\u2019\
        s technology from many other peer-to-peer Blockchain technology\u2019s whitepapers.\
        \ Tron Foundation, however, pointed out that the apparent similarities between\
        \ the different whitepapers are due to the poor English translation, as the\
        \ original Tron Whitepaper was published in Chinese and is an original authentic\
        \ work of its developers (Brown, 2018).<br />\r\nIn yet another controversy,\
        \ Tron\u2019s CEO, Justin Sun, was accused of money-laundering, illegal fund-raising,\
        \ porn transaction facilitation and gambling by the Chinese media. Tron Foundation\
        \ released an official statement, disregarding and disapproving the claims\
        \ while asserting that it is a core policy of Tron Foundation that their protocol\
        \ should not be used for unlawful purposes (Zmudzinski, 2019).<br />\r\nJustin\
        \ Sun was also scheduled to co-host a lunch with Warren Buffet in presence\
        \ of many Blockchainleaders in July. However, the event was postponed by Tron\
        \ Foundation who claimed that Justin was diagnosed with kidney stones and\
        \ had to attend to his medical procedures. Some argued otherwise claiming\
        \ that the postponement was made in wake of the negative news about Justin\
        \ Sun, who supposedly laundered money, circulating in the media (Steven Russolillo,\
        \ 2019). <br />\r\n"
