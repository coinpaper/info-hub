  introduction: General Data and Information. EOSIO was developed and launched by
    block.one (white paper released in 2017), a company headed by Daniel Larimer (formerly
    of Bitshares and Steemit) and Brendan Blumer. It was one of the most famous (if
    not THE most) ICOs (Initial Coin Offering), with an almost year long uncapped
    ICO being offered to investors between June 2017 and June 2018, resulting in a
    funding of almost 4 billion US dollars.
  technology: Milestones. 26th June 2017 - ICO begins, ERC20 tokens offered on Ethereum
    blockchain. 3rd September 2017 - Testnet (Dawn 1.0) launched. 4th December 2017
    - Testnet (Dawn 2.0) launched. 25th January 2018 - Testnet (Dawn 3.0) launched.
    7th May 2018 - Testnet (Dawn 4.0) launched. 1st June 2018 - ICO concludes, nearly
    4 billion USD raised. 1st June 2018 - EOS Mainnet launches, all ERC-20 tokens
    frozen and transferred to new chain.
  future: "The EOS token is mainly used for the \u201Cpurchase\u201D of network resources\
    \ (CPU/RAM) required to interact with the blockchain, but it also finds use in\
    \ being a common currency for the DEXs and dApps built on the EOS blockchain as\
    \ well as being a measure (when staked) of voting weight for choosing block producers."

        \ EOS. EOS is a network based on the much-famous Ethereum Blockchain. This\
        \ is where it gets its unofficial naming i.e. Ethereum Operating System (The\
        \ Analyst Team, 2018).<br />\r\nOne can say EOS is an updated version of the\
        \ Ethereum Blockchain, but a more improved and updated version. EOS technology\
        \ was developed with the primary aim of building a network that can support\
        \ and provide a more efficient and scalable platform for decentralized applications.\
        \ It performs a number of similar functions, but more efficiently and swiftly.\
        \ When Ethereum was released initially, it claimed to have been the first\
        \ Blockchain to support decentralized applications. Sooner, it was revealed\
        \ that it needed more improvements as it was plagued by a lot of scalability\
        \ issues. What EOS technology does, in summary, is that it adds another layer\
        \ to the Ethereum network to help address these issues, taking the world closer\
        \ towards the possibility of decentralization.<br />\r\n"
