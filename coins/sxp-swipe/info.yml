  one_sentence: Wallet and Crypto debit card
  introduction: Swipe is a digital application that offers a Multi-Asset Blockchain
    Wallet that allows users to store assets securely. The Swipe Wallet has been designed
    to require Swipe Tokens SXP to perform all functions and utility of the Wallet
    including to use the services and to make withdraws. Users on the Swipe Wallet
    can buy, sell, and pay with their cryptocurrencies to fiat directly within the
    Wallet application as well as purchase Gift Cards and make instant exchanges between
    all supported assets. Users are able to use their SXP tokens on launch and there
    are also tiered benefits based on the SXP holding on the Wallet Contract.
  technology: All Swipe Wallets require a 1 SXP deposit to activate and utilize on-chain
    functions based on an audited Smart Wallet-Contract to perform its duties. The
    protocol has been designed and built on Ethereum and destroys 80% of network and
    transaction fees are and 20% of the fees are retained by the company. Swipe Wallet
    Ltd is the company behind the project and is based in the United Kingdom. Swipe
    is founded by Joselito Lizarondo who also serves as the companies CEO. Joselito
    has been involved in cryptocurrency payment startups over the course of the last
    3 years all with similar executed plans and visions.

    \ both iOS and Android and will be releasing it to the full public soon. The Swipe\
    \ Card which is a Visa Debit Card is issued by a financial institution and program\
