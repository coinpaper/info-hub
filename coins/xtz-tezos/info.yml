  one_sentence: Smart contracts with advanced protocol
  introduction: Tezos is a self-amending blockchain that can evolve by upgrading itself.
    Stakeholders vote on amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the voting
    procedure itself, to reach social consensus on proposals. Tezos supports smart
    contracts and offers a platform to build decentralized applications.
  technology: On-Chain Governance. The Tezos protocol offers a formal process through
    which stakeholders can efficiently govern the protocol and implement future innovations.
    Security.
  future: "The Tezos blockchain was designed to facilitate formal verification, which\
    \ helps secure smart contracts and avoid buggy code. Proof-of-Stake. Tezos\u2019\
    \ unique proof-of-stake consensus algorithm gives every stakeholder the opportunity\
    \ to participate in the validation of transactions on the network and be rewarded\
    \ by the protocol for doing so."

  abstract: 'Tezos, a generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. Tezos can instantiate
    any blockchain based ledger. The operations of a regular blockchain are implemented
    as a purely functional module abstracted into a shell responsible for network
    operations. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptonote, etc. can all be represented within
    Tezos by implementing the proper interface to the network layer. Most importantly,
    Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code.'

      description: "After Dynamic Ledger Systems (DLS) announced their adamant vision\
        \ of developing a technology of the sort of Tezos in 2014, the cryptocurrency\
        \ much to people\u2019s surprise was dormant in the market, but as it turned\
        \ out, a lot was happening behind the scenes rather than on its marketing.\
        \ The team spent quite a time developing the ledger system of Tezos and then\
        \ finally in 2017, DLS butted heads with Tezos Foundation to hold its first-ever\
        \ Initial Coin Offering (ICO) event.<br />\r\nTezos Foundation, under Johann\
        \ Gavers, drew a massive hype and brought a lot of attention to Tezos cryptocurrency\
        \ in their first ICO which began on 1 July 2017. In a record-breaking event,\
        \ Tezos managed to raise $232 million which showcased the belief and trust\
        \ the users put in the technology (Frankenfield, 2019).<br />\r\nHowever,\
        \ things went downhill for both Tezos Foundation and DLS soon after their\
        \ successful ICO launch. It was revealed that Arthur Breitman, a former employee\
        \ of Morgan Stanley, had not disclosed his involvement in DLS and had built\
        \ Tezos architecture while still working at Morgan Stanley. He was, for this\
        \ reason, fined $20,000 by FINRA and suspended from associating himself with\
        \ any broker-dealer firms (The Analyst Team, 2018).<br />\r\nIn a turn of\
        \ events, a public squabble between the Breitmans, who owned the intellectual\
        \ rights of Tezos, and Johann Gavers, the head of Tezos Foundation, broke\
        \ out. Gavers refused to release the funds generated through the ICO to DLS.\
        \ As a result of the dispute, the launch of the Tezos platform was delayed\
        \ and it led to mayhem within the Tezos community. After being in the news\
        \ for the bad reason, Gavers decided to step down from Tezos Foundation. He\
        \ left the company with a severing amount of $400,000 and a broken image of\
        \ the Foundation. However, since then, the developments regarding Tezos have\
        \ streamlined and things are getting back into shape (Mitra, 2019).<br />\r\
        \nThough no official statistics are available, it is believed that Tezos Blockchain\
        \ will generate a whopping 10 billion Tezos Tokens. This might create inflation\
