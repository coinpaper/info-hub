  one_sentence: Global transactions for financial institutions
  introduction: "Ripple, the company behind xRapid, xCurrent and XRP solutions continues\
    \ to invest heavily in developing its ecosystem.  Its main objective has always\
    \ been to increase the intrinsic value of its currency and trading technologies,\
    \ as well as taking the adoption of cryptocurrencies to a new level. The company\
    \ recently partnered with MoneyGram, an international money transfer service.\
    \  The initial idea of \u200B\u200Bthe partnership was for MoneyGram to test xRapid\
    \ and xCurrent as transaction tools. XRapid and xCurrent can be used to settle\
    \ international transactions fast and cheap."
  technology: Fortunately the test seems to have been a success as MoneyGram has announced
    that it will adopt XRP and Ripple's solutions in full. According to ZyCrypto,
    xRapid was considered an efficient form of transaction, reducing the time and
    cost of transfer settlements. Interestingly, the recent partnership was born of
    a rivalry.  Ripple, which is trying to bring a revolution for transfer solutions,
    had MoneyGram as its direct competitor, since both were in the same industry.
  future: This is where both sides win and the cryptocurrency ecosystem benefits.
    The news is excellent for the XRP, but there is no price movement yet. XRP remains
    the third largest in the industry at $ 0.316480 and up 1.5%, moving similarly
    to the rest of the cryptocurrency. It is possible that when the partnership gains
    strength, the currency will appreciate more, but this is far from certain.  In
    addition, altcoins have been at a low point for a few weeks..

whitepaper:
  abstract: While several consensus algorithms exist for the Byzantine Generals Problem,
    specifically as it pertains to distributed payment systems, many suffer from high
    latency induced by the requirement that all nodes within the network communicate
    synchronously.  The result is a low-latency consensus algorithm which still maintains
    robustness in the face of Byzantine failures.

      description: "The minds behind the Ripple technology are Chris Larsen and McCaleb.\
        \ McCaleb is a competent, skilful programmer and has several ventures to his\
        \ name. He founded the famous file sharing program eDonkey2000, which was\
        \ put down by the regulatory authorities and he was forced to pay $30 million\
        \ in compensation (Mennecke, 2006). Afterward, he created the website MtGox\
        \ (which was hacked on June 2011 \u2013 USD 9 million were stolen). He later\
        \ sold the website, while still holding a considerable amount of shares of\
        \ it (McCormack, 2019). <br />\r\nMcCaleb co-founded Ripple in 2012 with Larsen,\
        \ but his term there was short-lived. He left the Ripple network in 2014 to\
        \ start out his own cryptocurrency venture Stellar Lumens which is considered\
        \ as a Ripple fork. Currently, Larsen is single-handedly leading the Ripple\
        \ Team.<br />\r\n"
