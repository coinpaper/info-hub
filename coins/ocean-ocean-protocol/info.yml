  one_sentence: Ecosystem for the data economy
  introduction: A Decentralized Data Exchange Protocol to Unlock Data for AI. Ocean
    Protocol is kickstarting a Data Economy by breaking down data silos and equalizing
    access to data for all. An ecosystem for the data economy and associated services,
    with a tokenized service layer that securely exposes data, storage, compute and
    algorithms for consumption. Trustful Data Sharing. We bring together decentralized
    technology, a trust framework, and an ecosystem for data and related services.
    This allows for data to be shared while guaranteeing traceability, transparency,
    and privacy to enable data owners to maintain control of their data assets and
    access a wide range of marketplaces and services.
  technology: "A Tokenized Service Layer. The Ocean protocol provides a tokenized\
    \ service layer that offers data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption\
    \ with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve\
    \ as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality,\
    \ reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks. Discovery is facilitated by storing\
    \ and promoting metadata, linking assets and services, and providing a licensing\
    \ framework with pricing. 1001 Marketplaces. Any data marketplace can hook into\
    \ Ocean to provide \u201Clast mile\u201D services, connecting data providers and\
    \ consumers."
  future: The Ocean protocol is designed so that data owners control each dataset
    and cannot be locked into any single marketplace. The Mission to Unlock Data.
    Society is becoming increasingly reliant on data, especially with the advent of
    AI. However, a small handful of organizations with both massive data assets and
    AI capabilities attained worrying levels of control which is a danger to a free
    and open society. We aim to unlock data, for more equitable outcomes for users
    of data, using a thoughtful application of both technology and governance. Our
    team and community is committed to kick-starting a New Data Economy that reaches
    every single person, company and device, giving power back to data owners and
    enabling people to capture value from data to better our world..
