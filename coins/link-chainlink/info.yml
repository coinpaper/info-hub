  one_sentence: Oracle platform - link between payment systems
  introduction: General Data and Information. Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized
    network that provides information (oracles) to smart contracts. Founded in 2017
    by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, Chainlink aims to solve the problem of off-chain
    information sourcing by smart contracts for their execution parameters. Smart
    contracts are designed to execute automatically when certain paramenters are met,
    however, when these parameters exist off-chain there is a reliance on sources
    of information (known as oracles) to provide the necessary information.
  technology: ' The ChainLink network allows users who have either a data feed or
    information carrying APIs to easily provide information to smart-contracts in
    exchange for the LINK token. Milestones. September 2017 - ChainLink ICO. November
    2018 - Town Crier (smart contracts and data privacy projects) acquired. 13th June
    2019 - Partnership with Google announced. Utility. The Link Network provides timely
    and accurate information to smart contracts via a decentralized network of oracles
    (data feeds and APIs).'
  future: The LINK token serves as a payment for smart contracts that utilise the
    data provided by the Link Network, with oracles that provide accurate information
    being rewarded in proportion to their staked LINK. Significant Features. Partnerships
    with major industry players such as SWIFT and Google. Integrations by Ethereum
    sidechains such as Harmony, Celer and Matic. Average blocktime n/a; Total supply
    of 1 Billion LINK ; Oracle Consensus written into Ethereum Blockchain via threshold
    signatures.

  abstract: Smart contracts are poised to revolutionize many industries by replacing
    the need for both traditional legal agreements and centrally automated digital
    agreements. Both performance verification and execution rely on manual actions
    from one of the contracting parties, or an automated system that programmatically
    retrieves and updates relevant changes. ChainLink provides on-chain components
    for (smart-) contracts to gain external connectivity.
