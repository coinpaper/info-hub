  one_sentence: Rent and lend unused hard drive space
  introduction: Sia is reinventing cloud storage. Our technology connects users who
    need file storage with hosts worldwide offering underutilized hard drive capacity.
    Blockchain technology secures their data and enables improved economics for users
    and hosts. The Sia blockchain allows this marketplace to run without an intermediary.
  technology: "Sia secures storage transactions with smart contracts, creating a more\
    \ reliable and affordable offering when compared to traditional cloud providers.\
    \ No one person or organization can censor or deny access to data\u2014not miners,\
    \ not developers, nor any government. We believe Sia\u2019s distributed, decentralized\
    \ storage technology is stronger, more secure, more efficient, and more equitable\
    \ for the entire ecosystem. We believe that neither individuals nor institutions\
    \ should be beholden to large corporations. Sia was created to promote and safeguard\
    \ users\u2019 freedoms. It\u2019s our attempt to bring decentralized storage built\
    \ on blockchain technology to the mainstream without sacrificing price or performance."
  future: Our long term goal is for Sia to become the backbone storage layer of the
    Internet. Nebulous, Inc. was established in 2014 and launched the Sia Storage
    Platform in 2015. Based in Boston, Nebulous is funded by Raptor Group, First Star
    Ventures, Fenbushi Capital and INBlockchain..

    description: Sia captures that rebellious hacker spirit that spurns the current
      paradigm and, instead, builds something novel, powerful, esoteric. Code is eating
      the world; blockchains are just a continuation of that trend, extending it into
      the world of finance.
