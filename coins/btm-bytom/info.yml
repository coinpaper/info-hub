  one_sentence: Smart contracts for asset management
  introduction: Bytom Blockchain Protocol (hereinafter referred as Bytom) is an interactive
    protocol of multiple byteassets. Heterogeneous byte-assets (indigenous digital
    currency, digital assets) that operate in different forms on the Bytom Blockchain
    and atomic assets (warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information,
    forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world)
    can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and
    contract-based interoperations via Bytom. The protocol connects the atomic world
    and the byteworld to promote the interaction and circulation of assets between
    the two worlds.
  technology: 'Bytom adopts three-layer architecture: application layer, contract
    layer and data transmission layer. The application layer is friendly to mobile
    and other terminals and convenient for developers to develop asset management
    applications. The contract layer use genesis contract and control contracts for
    asset issuance and management, supporting scalable BUTXO of UTXO model at the
    bottom layer, optimizing EVM and using introspection mechanism to prevent deadlock
    in Turing complete.'
  future: The data transmission layer adopts DLT technology to achieve asset issuance,
    spending, transfer and other operations. The consensus mechanism uses POW algorithm
    that are friendly to AI ASIC chips. Matrix and convolution calculation is introduced
    into the hashing process so that the miners can be used for AI hardware acceleration
    services, generating additional social benefits..
