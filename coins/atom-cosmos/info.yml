  one_sentence: Global transactions with multiple blockchains
  introduction: "Developed by the Tendermint team since 2016, Cosmos is a highly forward-looking\
    \ cross-chain blockchain project that aims to achieve a \u201Cblockchain-based\
    \ internet\u201D based on token transfer and to construct a deeply integrated\
    \ token economy ecosystem."
  technology: Cosmos Hub is the first cross-chain hub of the Cosmos ecosystem, and
    ATOM is the native staking token of Cosmos Hub, which can be used for spam prevention,
    staking dividends, and community management voting.
  future: We can not provide any looks into the future for Cosmos yet.

    purpose:
      description: 'The purpose behind Cosmos was a little too demanding for sure. Where other 
      crypto-technologies are trying to solve one problem at a time, Cosmos revealed that it will 
      launch a blockchain-based interoperability platform, which will allow all the different 
      blockchains to interact and work together. It kind of pulls all the blockchains onto one 
      platform, and as per the latest news of February 2020, it looks like they are getting some 
      results out of their works.'

    scandals_highlights:
      description: 'Cosmos was founded with the support of the Interchain Foundation (ICF); a 
      non-commercial foundation based in Switzerland. Cosmos held the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) 
      for its ATOM token in 2017. The ICO turned out to be successful, where the team managed to 
      raise $17 million within the first half an hour of the ICO. A total of 168 million tokens 
      were sold, while the team kept apart 50 million of the total supply to use for their 
      financial and strategic goals.
      Cosmos, with its idea of joining all other blockchains to eliminate the problem of blockchain 
      scalability, gained massive recognition in the year 2019. The project received countless 
      investments, so much so that Cosmos became the 25th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market 
      capitalization. This ranking was revealed by Coinpaper.io. The total market capital that Cosmos 
      has attracted so far stands at about $300 million, with each token trading at about $2.16.'

      more efficient. ATOM is the native token for the platform, and the delegators and valuators 
      of a transaction will be rewarded with ATOM tokens '
