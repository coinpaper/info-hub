  one_sentence: Stable coin backed by Coinbase
  introduction: USD Coin (USDC) is a fully collateralized US Dollar stablecoin based
    on the open source fiat stablecoin framework developed by Centre, a consortium
    founded by Circle and Coinbase. USDC tokens are ERC-20 compatible and can be used
    with any ERC-20 compatible digital wallet or service.
  technology: Customers from around the world can tokenize US Dollars into USDC and
    / or redeem USDC back into US Dollars with Circle (https://usdc.circle.com) and
    Coinbase (https://www.coinbase.com). USDC is fully collateralized - every unit
    of USDC is only ever issued after a corresponding US Dollar is deposited in reserve
    bank accounts.
  future: Reserve funds are held with multiple US-based banks. USDC is built on openness
    and accountability, enshrined in the governance and technology standards effort
    of Centre..

whitepaper:
  abstract: "True financial interoperability requires a price stable means of value\
    \ exchange. CENTRE\u2019s technology for fiat-backed stablecoins brings stability\
    \ to crypto. The initial implementation is USD//Coin (USDC), an ERC-20 token creating\
    \ possibilities in payments, lending, investing, trading and trade finance \u2014\
    \ and the ecosystem will grow as other fiat currency tokens are added.\
    \ As more goods and services are tokenized, smart contract platforms will become\
    \ fundamental building blocks of value exchange."

  introduction:
    purpose:
      description: 'After the crypto bull-run of 2017 and the havoc wrecked on the crypto-markets 
      in early 2018, the crypto-community turned their attention towards the high-volatility issue 
      of the crypto-currencies. It was high-time something was done to ensure that the markets are 
      not manipulated in any way and to ensure that some mechanism is there to safeguard it against 
      the rapid fluctuations in the crypto-markets. As a result, the concept of stablecoins gained 
      momentum.
      A USD Coin tries to amalgamate the benefits of the cryptocurrencies with the stability of the 
      fiat currencies. It lets its users transfer money quickly all around the world while maintaining 
      its value to $1'

    scandals_highlights:
      description: 'Talking about the history of USD Coin, it is important to note that it is a 
      relatively newer and fresher coin of the lot. This stablecoin cryptocurrency was specifically 
      built to combat the high volatility issues linked with mainstream crypto-tokens while making a 
      quick and easy transaction possible for the users.
      USD Coin became an instant hit largely due to the good reputation of its founding companies, 
      Coinbase and Circle. The technology and the underlying framework were developed by Centre, 
      while its distribution was first announced by Circle and Coinbase. What USD Coin has practically 
      done is that it has brought the US Dollar on to the blockchain, allowing the movement of 
      payments over the cryptocurrency network.'

    product:
      description: 'The actual product is a crypto-token whose value is backed by the US Dollar. 
      It is already being offered on different exchanges, including Coinbase. This doesn’t mean 
      that the tokens are just created out of one’s own will. Rather, every USD token that is 
      released into the markets must have a US dollar stored in the reserves at the back end. The 
      reserves must be looked after by the issuing companies and audited frequently. This process 
      is known as tokenization'

    partnerships:
      description: 'One of the earliest partnerships the USD Coin made was with Bitmain and Centre. 
      Back in 2018, Bitmain became a key supporter of Centre’s framework and USDC as it leads a $110 
      million strategic investment in Circle. 
      USDC also has several banking partners, including Silvergate bank and US Bankcorp Asset 
      Management (USBAM). Circle has also partnered with Grant Thornton LLP for a monthly check-up 
      on the US Dollar reserve balances for the USDC tokens.'

    prediction:
      description: 'From the price valuation point of view, USD Coin will not show any variation in 
      its price, because essentially it is only a reflection of a US Dollar. The price of USD Coin 
      will, therefore, stay at $1 for years to come. 
      Commenting on its usage, USD Coin will surely have its popularity increased in the coming years. 
      This is largely because the crypto-community has seen a trend-shift towards the use of stablecoins 
      recently.'
