  one_sentence: Bitcoin copy with faster transaction times
  introduction: "Bitcoin Cash (BCH also known as BCHABC)\
    \ is a hard-fork of Bitcoin after consensus was not reached on the question of\
    \ increasing the blocksize of the original Bitcoin. An increased blocksize (Bitcoin\
    \ Cash has a maximum block size of 8MB compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 1MB) was seen\
    \ by backers (such as Roger Ver) as enabling Bitcoin to function better as a regularly\
    \ used currency, as a larger block size would enable more transactions to be recorded\
    \ per block (without decreasing the average block time) thus increasing the capacity\
    \ of the blockchain. However, opponents of the increased block size argued that\
    \ the increased block size and increased demands on storage for the complete blockchain\
    \ would risk increased centralization of miners capacity (as the costs of running\
    \ mining nodes would increase further beyond the ability of smaller pools and\
    \ individual miners). As no consensus was reached, the faction supporting the\
    \ larger block size hard-forked Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin. Apart from this increased\
    \ blocksize, Bitcoin Cash is technically similar to the original Bitcoin and it\
    \ is currently the most well known and most liquid of the blockchains that have\
    \ forked from the Bitcoin blockchain."
  technology: 1st August 2017 - Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard forks from Bitcoin (BTC)  at
    block height 478558. 1st August 2017 - Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) also
    added as an additional difficulty reduction algorithm (able to reduce by 20%)
    in the event that time for 6 consecutive blocks exceeds 12 hours. 15th November
    2018 - Bitcoin SV hard forks from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at block height 556766. Utility.
    Just like the original Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash sees itself as a store of value which
    is unrestrained by national and political borders. It envisages an economic system
    whereby two parties can exchange value trustlessly and instantly, free from interference
    and mediation from third parties. The move to a larger block size was to enable
    a greater number of transactions to be written to the blockchain without altering
    other fundamental parameters of the original Bitcoin. This positions Bitcoin Cash
    as a faster moving store of value crypto-currency with a greater emphasis on liquidity
    and velocity in comparison to Bitcoin. Significant Features.
  future: "Decentralized access allowing any party with the open-source software and\
    \ internet access to send and receive Bitcoin Cash irreversibly without third\
    \ party interference or trust. Decentralized governance via open-source development\
    \ and forking. Future scaling via increased block size against Bitcoin (8MB vs\
    \ 1MB), currently the full capacity is not utilised. Transactions are pseduo-anonymous.\
    \ Funds are sent address to address, but an owner identity can eventually attributed\
    \ to an address given enough data and analysis. Average blocktime of 10 minutes;\
    \ Total supply of 21 million BCH; Consensus via Proof of Work (SHA-256). As of\
    \ June 2019, research shows that the Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjustment algorithm\
    \ appears to maintain a more stable block generation time under highly variable\
    \ hash power in comparison to Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm. References: . Bitcoin\

      description: "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a forked (copied) version of Bitcoin (BTC).\
        \ Before jumping right into its details, it is essential to learn the basics\
        \ of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system\
        \ that took the world by storm as it was not controlled by any authority or\
        \ a single institute. As the hype grew, more and more people got involved\
        \ in the technology to the point where it was discovered that it had creating\
        \ issues and transactional bottenecks and something was needed to address\
        \ the scalability issues of Bitcoin. Now, the thing that needed to be done\
        \ led to the inception of a forked technology of Bitcoin, by the name of Bitcoin\
        \ Cash (BCH).<br />\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) came into being after serious concerns\
        \ were raised about the scalability and speed of the Bitcoin Network, so much\
        \ that it was agreed that its future was in jeopardy. Therefore, Bitcoin Cash\
        \ (BCH) forked (copied) off the main Bitcoin (BTC) in August 2017. The purpose\
        \ behind it was to address the aforementioned issues relating to Bitcoin.\
        \ Bitcoin Cash fixed the mining limitation linked with Bitcoin. Previously,\
        \ what used to happen was that the transactional fees rose to very high levels\
        \ when there was a massive inflow of transaction requests. Bitcoin Cash increased\
        \ the block size of the mining block from 1MB to 8MB so that more transactions\
        \ could be processed per second. In November 2018, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also\
        \ forked into two newer versions, namely Bitcoin ABC (BCHABC) and Bitcoin-Satoshi-Vision\
        \ (BSV) (CryptoChief, 2019).<br />\r\n"

      description: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), now Bitcoin Cash ABC, has always been in the
        news for the wrong reason, and for that reason has started to lose its integrity
        over time. One such incident took place in May 2019. An intentional upgrade
        was planned and announced that was supposed to enhance the performance of
        the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network. Normally, such activities are controlled by
        the mining groups who have the potential to push new upgrades, deny upgrades,
        and initiate upgrades from the community. BTC.top is a company that controls
        over 51% of the hashing power of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (Memoria, 2019). BTC.top
        misused its power on 15 May 2019 by hijacking a mining block previously controlled
        by another company called Prohashing. As a reaction, Prohashing called it
        out and announced the very next day that they would cease all Bitcoin Cash
        (BCH) mining from immediate effect (Hertig, 2019).
