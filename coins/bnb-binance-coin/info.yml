  one_sentence: Payment token for the Binance exchange
  introduction: From the ICO, Binance issued its own coin called the Binance Coin,
    with BNB as the symbol. BNB runs natively on Binance chain. The coin was established
    with a total supply of 200 million. Every quarter, we will destroy BNB based on
    the trading volume on our crypto-to-crypto platform until we destroy 50% of all
    the BNB. All transactions will be on the blockchain. We eventually will destroy
    100MM BNB, leaving 100MM BNB remaining. The BNB coin itself has multiple forms
    of utility, essentially being the underlying gas that powers the Binance Ecosystem.
  technology: "- Crypto.com has included support for Binance\u2019s BNB token to its\
    \ platform which includes the MCO Visa Card and mobile app. - Uplive platform\
    \ supports BNB to buy virtual gifts. - Nexo platform supports the BNB coin as\
    \ collateral for instant crypto loans. BNB Value & The Burn . You can use BNB\
    \ to pay for any fees on Binance platform, including but not limited to: Exchange\
    \ fees, Listing fees, and any other fee."
  future: 'All transactions will be on the blockchain. We
    eventually will destroy 100MM BNB, leaving 100MM BNB  remaining. Decentralized
    Exchange. On April 23, 2019, Binance has completed the Binance Coin (BNB) mainnet
    swap. In the future, Binance will build a decentralized exchange, where BNB will
    be used as one of the key base assets as well as gas to be spent..'

        has rightfully earned quite the reputation among cryptocurrency users and

        exchange. The platform maintains its repute and integrity by filtering out
        any coin that shows negative behaviour and is not suitable for the cryptocurrency
        community. Some of the indicators that become the reason for the fall out
        is lack of commitment of the team, low level of code and network quality,
        public acceptance and evidence of unethical business conduct. This is how
        Binance scrutinizes all cryptocurrencies that it offers (Binance, 2019 March
