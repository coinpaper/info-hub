  one_sentence: Stablecoin that should stay at the value of 1 USD
  introduction: General Data and Information. Announced in July 2014 by Brock Pierce,
    Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars as Realcoin, Tether (USDT) is the most popular
    and liquid stablecoin in the crypto-currency ecosystem. It is a token that was
    first issued on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Omni Layer platform, however
    it has since been launched as a token on various other blockchains (Ethereum,
    Tron, EOS and Algorand).
  technology: "6th October 2014 - First tokens issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via\
    \ the Omni Layer. 20th November 2014 - Renamed to \u201CTether\u201D. January\
    \ 2015 - USDT trading enabled on Bitfinex, other crypto exchanges follow suit.\
    \ 5th January 2018 - USDT tokens supported on Ethereum. 27th November 2018 - Direct\
    \ customer (non-exchange) fiat redemption enabled. 4th March 2019 - USDT tokens\
    \ supported on TRON. 31st May 2019 - USDT tokens supported on EOS. 29 th July\
    \ 2019 - USDT tokens supported on Liquid Network."
  future: Designed to be backed 1:1 by fiat (US dollars), Tether tokens (USDT) are
    minted or burnt (destroyed) as the reserves held by Tether (the company) increase
    (via deposits) or fall (via claims against the tokens). In this way, Tether tokens
    are seen as a stable store of value in an otherwise highly volatile crypto-currency
    ecosystem.

whitepaper:
  abstract: "A digital token backed by fiat currency provides individuals and organizations\
    \ with a robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar\
    \ accounting unit. The innovation of blockchains is an auditable and cryptographically\
    \ secured global ledger. Asset\xADbacked token issuers and other market participants\
    \ can take advantage of blockchain technology, along with embedded consensus systems,\
    \ to transact in familiar, less volatile currencies and assets."

      description: "One of the biggest limitations the cryptocurrency technologies\
        \ battle is the huge price swings in their valuations which render them slightly\
        \ impractical for day-to-day trading. Keeping this concern in mind, a new\
        \ breed of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins was introduced. Stablecoins\
        \ are backed by real-world fiat currencies like the US Dollar or Japanese\
        \ Yen. Tether (USDT) is a Blockchain cryptocurrency backed by the US dollar\

        \ a tool of investment. It is essential to tackle the problem of wide price\
        \ swings if we want to see a future where cryptocurrencies could be used to\
        \ run day-to-day business transactions. Tether aims to achieve that. Its fixed-price\
        \ follows that of the US Dollar, which provides an incentive to the masses\
        \ to spend token rather than \u2018HODL-ing\u2019 them (Frankenfield, 2019).\

      description: "Since this stable coin was brought into the mainstream, it has\
        \ managed to capture a considerable amount of cryptocurrency exchange activity.\
        \ Tether is used in about 40-80 percent of all transactions happening on the\
        \ leading exchanges of Binance and Huobi. A large part of the transactions\
        \ sees the purchase of Bitcoin using Tether tokens. In August 2019, amidst\
        \ the devastating performances of many cryptocurrencies, Tether managed to\
        \ record its all-time high activity with a total market capital reaching up\
        \ to $4 billion (Cuen, 2019). <br />\r\nHowever, Tether\u2019s history has\
        \ not always been right on track. In November 2017, a cyber-attack on the\
        \ Tether network resulted in a theft of about $31 million tokens. This caused\
        \ panic and made Stablecoin users more security conscious. A little fast forward\
        \ to January 2018 and Tether was faced with another controversy which was\
        \ as a result of the bad faith demonstrated by the parent company Tether Ltd.\
        \ As Tether, and all other stable coins are backed by a real-world currency\
        \ that is supposed to be deposited in a bank account as collateral. Each Tether\
        \ token is paired by a US Dollar. Tether Limited did not go through with the\
        \ mandatory audit which was supposed to ensure that the real world reserves\
        \ are maintained. This lack of transparency gave rise to the winds of suspicion\
        \ and mistrust (Seth, 2018). <br />\r\nTether Foundation is the main body\
        \ that supplies Tether tokens. They used to state that every Tether token\
        \ is backed by a real-world US Dollar deposited in reserves. However, it was\
        \ alleged that this was not the case. As much as 25% of the Tether valuations\
        \ come from loans taken to fill the reserve which is something to be worried\
        \ about. Contrary to their popular claim that each Tether is backed by a US\
        \ Dollar, it has been established now that these claims were evidently empty.\
        \ According to a Tether\u2019s spokesperson and the official website as well\
        \ (under the Transparency description), it has been revealed that instead\
        \ of 100% US dollar reserves, it has \u2018cash equivalents\u2019. Interestingly,\
        \ these \u2018cash equivalents\u2019 are presumed to be loans and other cryptocurrencies\
        \ as well. So the whole concept of pairing the cryptocurrency to a stable\
        \ fiat currency goes down the drain because the \u2018equivalent-reserves\u2019\
        \ are themselves highly volatile in nature. So, in short, Tether has also\
        \ become an unregulated crypto-currency and the investors might be in for\
        \ a surprise; perhaps, not a good one (Coppola, 2019).<br />\r\n"
