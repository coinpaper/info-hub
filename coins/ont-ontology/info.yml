  introduction: "General Data and Information. Ontology is a public blockchain project\
    \ with distributed data collaboration aiming to build a peer to peer cross system\
    \ trust network. Ontology trust network provides a strategic cooperation of data\
    \ systems and trust sources. This network is composed of decentralized identity\
    \ verification systems, multi factor authentication, distributed ledger technology\
    \ and distributed data exchange All business types can be applied to Ontology\
    \ blockchain technology without the need of users having prior knowledge on distributed\
    \ networks. Led by a global blockchain expert team, Ontology provides distributed\
    \ infrastructure to various businesses and decentralized applications. Ontology\
    \ aims to bind decentralized digital world to the real world using \u201COntology\
    \ Common\u201D or \u201COntology Custom\u201D designs. These designs enable secure\
    \ end effective decentralized systems. Ontology\u2019s ecosystem can be divided\
    \ into three categories: The Technological Ecosystem, The Application Ecosystem\
    \ and The Governance Ecosystem."
  technology: 'Ontology system architecture has a flexible design allowing for expansions
    and support for ever growing applications. The businesses Ontology aims to support
    include distributed ledgers, smart contracts, distributed authentication protocols,
    distributed data exchange protocols, and more.  The layers of Ontology network
    can be divided into three: core layer, application layer and user layer. Core
    layer is composed of protocols and chain groups, application layer is composed
    of partners, application frameworks and modules, and the user layer is composed
    of Ontology ecosystem application users. Partners hold great importance building
    the Ontology ecosystem. Milestones. In 2017, Ontology was the first China based
    blockchain project to join DIF. In 2018, Ontology released the VBFT consensus
    algorithm, announced the consensus economic model, released the ONTO app, was
    selected as a part of Microsoft Accelerator and announced their sharding design.
    In 2019, Ontology development platform was added to Google Cloud Marketplace,
    and Ontology multichain design, WASM Testnet and multichain testnet was released.
    Utility.'
  future: There are more than 2 million community contributors, 900 technical contributors,
    190 partners and 200 team members in Ontology Blockchain Network. There are also
    50 and growing dApps, 56 nodes and more than 517000 wallet addresses in Ontology
    Ecosystem. Ontology token uses VBFT, a combination of three different models of
    Proof of Stake (PoS), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Verifiable Random Functions
    (VRF). The application areas of Ontology include finance, payments, insurance,
    consumer, internet of things, media, software development, medicine, asset titles,
    and government activities such as voting systems. Significant Features. Ontology
    brings solutions to current trust system flaws such as data fragmentation, individual's
    lack of role, monopolization of data management, false identity verification,
    transparency and security issues, weak reputation systems and insufficient community
    management. Ontology offers blockchain solutions presenting custom modules to
    businesses with issuable trust and verifiable identity systems. One of the key
    powers of Ontology is dealing with current real-life business issues instead of
    presenting a framework for future cases..
