  one_sentence: Transfer of assets via Smart Contracts
  introduction: What is Ravencoin? To us, the RVN community, it's a new open-source
    project intended to see if a use case specific blockchain designed to be focused
    on the transfer of assets can develop technology which provides security or functional
    advantages for certain projects. Specifically working on things like RSK, which
    will allow Solidity to work on this chain, will be huge for Ravencoin in the future.
    RVN was launched January 3rd, 2018 with very little info regarding the future
    of the project. Since then, several community members have learned that there
    is an active development team on this coin, and the super clean wallet client
    and lightning fast network are only the beginning.
  technology: The RVN team is launching their coin in the spirit of Bitcoin, code
    first. We hope to keep you updated in this thread as to work being done on RVN,
    as that information becomes available to us. But you don't need to wait for us
    or take our word for it. Ravencoin is open source and ANYONE is free to contribute
    to the project, please, join the team in GitHub!.
  future: 'Ravencoin was launched in the interest of fair distribution. There is no
    ICO, no pre-mine, and you can mine RVN on readily available consumer-grade hardware!
    Several of us have been mining this coin since launch, and can attest that you
    can still currently hit blocks solo mining with your CPU through the wallet client,
    how long this will last, we can not say (Update: as of this writing February 2018,
    6 RVN pools exist, solo mining has officially become difficult). We have learned,
    however, that the team is very dedicated to making RVN an ASIC resistant project
    now and into the future. We believe in RVN as a project and aim to help the project
    grow, and we''re happy to have you join us!..'
