  one_sentence: Global transactions with very low fees
  introduction: Dash is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus
    on the payments industry. Dash offers a form of money that is anonymous, portable,
    inexpensive and fast.
  technology: It can be spent securely both online and in person with only minimal
    transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin project, Dash aims to be the most user-friendly
    and scalable payments system in the world.
  future: In addition to Bitcoin's feature set, Dash currently also includes a second-layer
    network of masternodes to facilitate instant transactions (InstantSend), private
    transactions (PrivateSend) and governance functions to create a self-governing
    and self-funding network capable of paying individuals and businesses for work
    that adds value to Dash. This decentralized governance and budgeting system makes
    it one of the first ever successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)..

        \ issues, many altcoins have emerged on the scenes, and Dash is one of them.<br\

        \ to be an easy to use cryptocurrency for mass adoption (Walters, 2019). It\
        \ has been built from the basics of blockchain technology to enable it to\
        \ become the simplest cryptocurrency buyers and merchants can use for their\
        \ daily transactions without going into much hassle or any stress. Dash has\
        \ reduced the transaction charges to such an extent that it could now be used\
        \ for micro-transactions, unlike Bitcoin. The fees for a normal transaction\
        \ is around $0.01. However, users are also given an option to make instant\
        \ transactions (InstantSend) or private transactions (PrivateSend) for additional\
        \ charges (Evan Duffield, 2018).<br />\r\n"

      description: "The beginning of Dash, or Xcoin, is marked with it forking off\
        \ the Bitcoin network. Its founder, Evan, initially programmed it in such\
        \ a way that only Linux systems were allowed to mine it. The history of Dash\
        \ gives rise to many suspicions, particularly because of its mining bugs.\
        \ According to Evan, a bug was introduced into the network code, which made\
        \ the so-called \u2018instamine\u2019 possible. Through this \u2018instamine\u2019\
        \ process, the team mined 2 million coins out of the 84 million total coins\
        \ within 24 hours, using 127 computers. It was later found out that 100 of\
        \ these computers were rented cloud computers that someone set up. Interestingly,\
        \ the cryptocurrency was not even functional back then, so this might actually\
        \ be an insider job. 2 million of 84 million tokens make 2.38% of the supply,\
        \ however, Evan changed the total supply from 84 Million to 18.9 Million,\
        \ without changing the existing supply in the same proportion. The instamined\
        \ coins were then 10.58% (2.38% before the supply change) of the total supply\
        \ which made these instamined coins more valuable. These same coins are used\
        \ to make master nodes, which means they are still generating Dash rewards\
        \ for their owners (Smooth, 2015). <br />\r\nDash has a history of deceitful\
        \ and not-so-trustworthy marketing. They were once involved in a marketing\
        \ scam where they claimed that KFC Venezuela was accepting Dash as a form\
        \ of payment. However, it was later discovered to be a false advertisement\
        \ (Berman, 2018). <br />\r\nIn early 2018, it was revealed that Dash has serious\
        \ centralization issues and this raised many concerns. It was later gathered\
        \ that two entities, whether they be people or companies, are controlling\
        \ around 80% of Dash mining. This makes it vulnerable to serious network issues\
        \ even if one of them creates any problem.<br />\r\n"

        is essential at this stage, as already a substantial amount of mining process

        seems not to be ready for what the Dash coin should be used for. Many people
