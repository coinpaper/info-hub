  introduction: "The theory behind Bitcoin was first\
    \ described by Satoshi Nakomoto in a whitepaper: A Peer to Peer Electronic\
    \ Cash System published to a cryptographic mailing list on the 31st of October\
    \ 2008. In this paper, Satoshi described the protocol (Proof of Work) that would\
    \ solve the double-spend problem inherent in non-physical (digital)\
    \ forms of currency. The first or Genesis block was mined by Satoshi on the 3rd\
    \ of January 2009, with the text -The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink\
    \ of second bailout for banks- written into the coinbase of the block"
  technology: "31st October 2008 - White paper released by Satoshi Nakomoto.\
    \ 3rd January 2009 - Genesis block mined by Satoshi Nakomoto. 12th January 2009 -\
    \  First transaction using Bitcoin; Satoshi Nakomoto sends 100 BTC to Hal Finney.\
    \ 22nd May 2010 - First recorded commercial transaction using Bitcoin; aka Pizza\
    \ Day. 14th January 2016 - Lightning Network white paper, a Layer-2 solution to\
    \ scaling Bitcoin. 1st August 2017 - Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork. 23rd August\
    \ 2017 - Segregated Witness (SegWit) implemented."
  future: 'Decentralized access allowing any party with the
    open-source software and internet access to send and receive Bitcoin irreversibly
    without third party interference or trust. Decentralized governance via open-source
    development and forking. Relatively slow block times in comparison to other
    crypto-currencies although there are solutions in development such as the Lightning
    Network aiming to solve the problem of scaling.'

whitepaper:
  abstract: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments
    to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial
    institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits
    are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
    We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.

      description: "In 2009, the concept of a peer-to-peer electronic payment system\
        \ was published in a whitepaper that revolutionized the world and laid foundations\
        \ for the birth of a multi-billion dollar industry of cryptocurrencies. Little\
        \ did anyone know that the technologies and applications the cryptocurrencies\
        \ provide will offer so much in value and open doors for further innovations.\
        \ Bitcoin was the very first cryptocurrency to be accepted as a peer-to-peer\
        \ version of an electronic payment system, therefore opening doors for other\
        \ cryptocurrencies to be born.<br />\r\nThe primary aim behind the inception\
        \ of Bitcoin was to provide people with an easier and more efficient means\
        \ of transaction that was not under the authority of any institution. Apart\
        \ from the decentralization concept, it intended to solve the delay and time-costly\
        \ transactional processes and cut down on the fee charges. Bitcoin, in summary,\
        \ was trying to achieve the same functionality as companies like PayPal, but\
        \ attempted to save users their money and render these third-party systems\
        \ obsolete and useless (Nakamoto, 2009).<br />\r\n"

        is difficult to predict whether it would be Bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency
        based on Blockchain or even some altcoin based on new technology. For Bitcoin
        to remain in the number game, it needs to address issues related to its transactional
        speed, transactional limits and the energy-intensive nature of its processes.
        If it can successfully solve these problems, it can maintain its position
        as the industry leader. Bitcoin still might be the future gold of cryptocurrencies.
