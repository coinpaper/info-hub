  one_sentence: Payment token for Bitfinex exchange
  introduction: "iFinex started its operations in 2012, initially operating under\
    \ the Bitfinex brand, making it one of the longest-standing exchanges in the industry.\
    \ Since then iFinex, through its trading platforms, has become one of the best-known\
    \ and recognized companies in the cryptocurrency space with a community of passionate\
    \ entrepreneurs, idealists and technologists that have together created one of\
    \ the best growth stories in our industry. Our guiding principle has always been\
    \ innovation for progress. We are known for building industry first products and\
    \ tools that accelerate the blockchain promise of freedom and scalability set\
    \ out in the original Bitcoin WhitePaper, \u201CBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic\
    \ Cash System,\u201D released in 2008."
  technology: "We also believe the best innovation and biggest progress comes from\
    \ opening our doors to the community, which is why we are dedicated to education\
    \ and open-source development within the cryptocurrency space. Developing for\
    \ innovation is a critical element of progress within cryptocurrencies, but driving\
    \ adoption is equally important. We maintain that the best chance of increasing\
    \ adoption of cryptocurrency is fiat currency cash flow\u2014increasing the speed\
    \ and ease by which fiat currencies can be exchanged for cryptocurrency in a legally-compliant\
    \ manner. We do not dispute that the end goal of cryptocurrencies is to displace\
    \ the place of fiat in our lives, but we believe that achieving these goals will\
    \ only be possible after the ecosystem has developed and matured."
  future: Moreover, investment from outside the industry needs to reach the many vital
    projects that are working hard to improve and scale the technology. For this reason,
    Bitfinex fights to defend the use of an independent fiat gateway. We are humbled
    and incredibly grateful that so many of our customers and community members share
    our approach and ethos and have actively supported us through times of adversity.
    Here we share an opportunity to stand together, united in our vision for the future
    of crypto..

      description: "The introduction of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in 2009,\
        \ heralded dawn of a new era. Since then the world of digital currencies has\
        \ garnered a tremendous amount of attention and has provided numerous alternatives\
        \ to fiat currencies. Owing to this, a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges started\
        \ to provide incentives to their users in order to maintain their popularity.\
        \ Bitfinex, a much-known cryptocurrency exchange, launched its own loyalty-building\
        \ token by the name of LEO which is mainly used for discounts on Bitfinex\u2019\
        s platform.<br />\r\nLEO Token is a proprietary exchange token offered by\
        \ Bitfinex. It was released in an Initial Coin Offering held by the exchange\
        \ company. The purpose of this and many other similar platform-based tokens\
        \ is just to provide an additional incentive to the users by offering them\
        \ discounts on trading fees if they use the token for their transactions on\
        \ the exchange platform (CryptoCompare, 2019).<br />\r\n"

    scandals_highlights:
      description: "The announcement for the release of the LEO token was made at\
        \ a time that its integrity was being questioned. The cryptocurrency exchange\
        \ platform Bitfinex had adventured by launching a stablecoin by the name of\
        \ Tether (USDT) in 2014. Some years down the track, they ran into a fund embezzlement\
        \ scandal in relation to Tether. It was claimed that they were short of $850\
        \ million in funds that were supposed to back/support the stablecoin Tether\
        \ (USDT). It was in the middle of this controversy that Bitfinex announced\
        \ the launch of the LEO Token (LEO). So naturally, the release of LEO Token\
        \ (LEO) worth $1 billion was seen as a double-dealing move made with the intention\
        \ of recovering the lost amount.<br />\r\nHowever, LEOToken (LEO) has still\
        \ managed to make its place in the market, despite the presence of many critics\
        \ and receiving a lot of backlashes. To make this stay possible, LEO Token\
        \ has some interesting features that differentiate it from other loyalty-tokens.\
        \ Firstly, Bitfinex has announced to buyback and burn tokens each month using\
        \ as much as 27% of its revenue. This gives it an edge over Binance\u2019\
        s BNB coin. Binance intends to only burn 50% of BNB coin, while Bitfinex will\
        \ eventually burn 100% of LEO tokens (Wheeler, 2019). <br />\r\nRecently,\
        \ a crypto research and analysis firm, Cointelligence, has claimed that the\
        \ smart contract of LEO token has been deliberately designed in such a way\
        \ that it can open ways for multi-billion-dollar fraud (Antonovici, 2019).<br\

  foresight:
    prediction:
      description: "It\u2019s uncertain whether or not LEOToken (LEO) will be able\

        \ exchange that itself has damaged its reputation and experienced the slowest\
        \ growth in 2019. People are gravitating towards different platforms that\
        \ are more attractive and whose proprietary tokens offer much better incentives.\
        \ Until Bitfinex releases itself from the clenching tentacles of the Tether\
        \ lawsuit, its future seems bleak and questionable, for sure (Comben, 2019).<br\
        \ />\r\nThe performance of LEO token wholly lies on the performance of its\
        \ platform Bitfinex, which quite frankly isn\u2019t doing too well. Bitfinex\
        \ showcased the smallest growth in 2019 compared to other popular cryptocurrency\
        \ exchanges. The lawsuits against the corporation don\u2019t seem like it\
