  one_sentence: Platform for smart contracts
  introduction: "Developers position Cardano as the \u201Cthird generation blockchain.\"\
    \ The main goal of the platform is to implement all the best features of Litecoin,\
    \ bitcoin and ethereum into one cryptocurrency; complementing the resulting mixture\
    \ with a number of additional innovative technologies. Security and reliability\
    \ are higher than Bitcoin, p2p transactions are faster and cheaper than Litecoin,\
    \ and smart contracts are better implemented than Ethereum."
  technology: "Cardano uses the innovative Proof of Stake algorithm called Ouroboros,\
    \ which is the first truly secure method for users, as confirmed by scientific\
    \ research. Legal support. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that offer anonymity and\
    \ sacrifice their reputation (money laundering charges), the Cardano team has\
    \ very well established relations with governments and regulatory authorities\
    \ (especially in Japan), which until recently had condemned the idea of \u200B\
    \u200Bcryptocurrencies."
  future: '- Continuous work to improve the project. - A serious approach to development,
    attracting the best scientists and businessmen to the project. - Stable flow of
    investors. - Plans to achieve full decentralization of the system. - The attractiveness
    of using innovative technological solutions in the project. - Cardano is an ambitious
    project that tackled many important issues of the crypto industry.'

  introduction:
    purpose:
      description: Cardano was built by a team of professionals including researchers,
        scientists, and engineers that took a strictly scientific approach. It was
        built with the aim of providing more enhanced and advanced functions of all
        other cryptocurrencies combined. The creators are adamant to roll out their
        own stack of technology that could support the implementation of smart contracts
        and to build a platform where developers can work on their decentralized applications
        (DApps). The blockchain also aims to achieve interoperability between other
        cryptocurrency blockchains (Kiayias, 2019).

        \ offering of ADA which managed to gather around $62,200,000 by the end of\
        \ January 2017. However, a vast majority (90%) of the ADA buyers were of Japanese\
        \ origin. This raised a serious concern in the crypto-community as this was\
        \ a major sign that the technology evidently lacked diversity. According to\
        \ Charles Hoskinson, the \u201CJapanese bias\u201D was due to the marketing\
        \ strategy of Cardano with its main focus on Japan, which is so because the\
        \ crypto-market there offers the most long term growth (McIntosh, 2018)."

      description: The Cardano Foundation is dedicated to steadily improving and updating
        platform, wallets, and concepts that can be used in the future for Cardano
        blockchain. The GitHub repository has been proven to be highly active and
        has a few thousand commits already. However, the amount of code updates each
        commit (upload of new code) offers is minimal. The language used for the Cardano
        blockchain codebase is the Haskell programming language, which is quite surprising,
        as the language is considered by a lot of experts to be widely obsolete, especially
        in this era of more modern languages.

        Metaps and launched a cryptocurrency prepaid card that will be released in

    prediction:
      description: For now, it is too soon to predict anything about Cardano. Sure,
        the technology looks impressive and the team might be able to develop and
        deliver a fully functional platform that could solve the problems that other
        Smart Contract centric cryptocurrencies are facing. Also, there have been
        a lot of promises on what Cardano plans to offer its users. Cardano will gain
        momentum in such events, but for now, it can be said that other platforms
        that are developed and currently offer better incentives will remain ahead
        of Cardano for the time being. Cardano is currently restricted to  East Asian
        countries and thus, will see its growth predominantly in these areas alone.

        and implementation of its platform. The team is also researching on KMZ sidechain

    potential:
      description: The potential for the growth of Cardano is massive as the industry
        is evolving each day. Developers are eager to shift to better systems and
        networks. It now depends on how fast the development team can finish their
        project and introduce revolutionary functions that could render other DApp
        platforms obsolete. The best possibility for the blockchain is that it could
        become the most widely used and default platform for the development of DApps.
