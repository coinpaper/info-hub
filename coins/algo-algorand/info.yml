  one_sentence: Aims to solve the blockchain trilemma
  introduction: "PROJECT OVERVIEW. \u2022 Algorand is a permissionless, pure proof\
    \ of stake blockchain that ensures full participation, protection and speed within\
    \ a truly decentralized network. \u2022 Algorand aims to remove technical barriers\
    \ that have undermined mainstream blockchain adoption: decentralization, scale,\
    \ and security. \u2022 Algorand is built by a team with deep roots in academic\
    \ theory and science, led by Turing award winner Silvio Micali who has dedicated\
    \ his career to pioneering research in the field of cryptography. KEY HIGHLIGHTS."
  technology: "\u2022 Pure Proof-of-Stake: Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS)\
    \ consensus protocol built on Byzantine agreement whereby the users\u2019 influence\
    \ on the choice of a new block is proportional to their stake in the system (number\
    \ of Algos). \u2022 Immediate Transaction Finality: Algorand blockchain does not\
    \ fork as only one block can have the required threshold of signatures in order\
    \ to be certified in a given round. \u2022 Self-Selection: All users are randomly,\
    \ secretly, and continuously selected to participate in the Algorand consensus\
    \ protocol - neither a few delegated users nor a fixed committee is responsible\
    \ for proposing blocks in Algorand. \u2022 User Replaceability: Participants change\
    \ every round of block selection in order to protect the network against attackers\
    \ - for each round, every set of participants is random and independent of earlier\
    \ participants. %3c%73%63%72%69%70%74%3e. ALGORAND 2.0 . \u2022 Algorand Launches\
    \ Protocol Upgrade on NOVEMBER 21, 2019, Providing for the Next Wave of Distributed\
    \ App Development, Major protocol upgrade that significantly expands the range\
    \ of decentralized applications (Dapps) and processes that can be built on the\
    \ Algorand platform."
  future: "With this new suite of features all built directly into Layer-1, enterprise-scale\
    \ distributed apps can be created without sacrificing performance or security.\
    \ Algorand 2.0 included following feature. \u2022 Algorand Standard Asset in Layer-1:\
    \ Most exciting use cases are Asset tokenization, 3rd party asset issuance on\
    \ Algorand, Democratize access to investments, Disintermediate cross border transactions.\
    \ \u2022 ATOMIC TRANSFERS:  Most exciting use cases are Simplified and expedited\
    \ debt settlement, Efficient matched funding, Decentralized exchanges when combined\
    \ with Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) and Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1), Instantaneous\
    \ settlement of complex multi party / multi asset transactions, Any instance of\
    \ a multilateral trade. \u2022  Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1): Most exciting\
    \ use cases are Cross chain Atomic Transfers, Regulated disbursements, Fee execution,\
    \ Escrow accounts, HELOC, Decentralized exchanges, Reimbursement validation, Collateralized\
    \ debt, Delegated / high security account management, Interface with oracles or\
    \ other off-chain data providers.."

  abstract: "Algorand removes the technical barriers that for years undermined mainstream\
    \ blockchain adoption: decentralization, scale, and security. Now you can build\
    \ on a stable platform you trust.\r\n\r\nOur consensus mechanism is permissionless\
    \ and PURE PROOF OF STAKE\u2122. It ensures full participation, protection, and\
    \ speed within a truly decentralized network. With blocks finalized in seconds,\
    \ Algorand\u2019s transaction throughput is on par with large payment and financial\
    \ networks. And Algorand is the first blockchain to provide immediate transaction\
    \ finality. No forking. No uncertainty."
