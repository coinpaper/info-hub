  one_sentence: Advertisements in the Brave Browser
  introduction: BAT (Basic Attention Token), a token for a decentralized ad exchange.
  technology: It compensates the browser user for attention while protecting privacy.
    BAT connects advertisers, publishers, and users and is denominated by relevant
    user attention, while removing social and economic costs associated with existing
    ad networks, e.g., fraud, privacy violations, and malvertising. BAT is a payment
    system that rewards and protects the user while giving better conversion to advertisers
    and higher yield to publishers.
  future: We see BAT and associated technologies as a future part of web standards,
    solving the important problem of monetizing publisher content while protecting
    user privacy..

  abstract: The solution for current online advertising problems is a decentralized,
    transparent digital ad exchange based on Blockchain. The first component is Brave,
    a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks third party ads and trackers,
    and builds in a ledger system that measures user attention to reward publishers
    accordingly.

        \ a drastic increase in the number of users and the significant amount of\
        \ attention being diverted towards the cryptocurrency technology. Many more\
        \ businesses were adamant to incorporate some cryptocurrency in their business\
        \ in some way or another. This led to the introduction of specialized coins\

        \ tokens. Among them is Basic Attention Coin (BAT).<br />\r\nThe Basic Attention\
        \ Token (BAT) is a specialized utility token which will be solely used within\
        \ the Brave-Browser Ecosystem. The Brave Browser is an internet browser whose\
        \ build is comparable to that of Google Chrome Browser. The catch, however,\
        \ is that Brave-Browser offers integrated Ad Blocker and Tracker Blocker which\
        \ serves as the solution to the ad spamming that frustrates internet users.\
        \ This results in faster browsing and small loading times as the user does\
        \ not have to process ad data as well. The browser also gives its users the\
        \ option to see ads that are verified by Brave, and if they do so, they will\
        \ be able to earn BAT tokens that can be used within the Brave ecosystem to\
        \ purchase several benefits on apps like YouTube and Twitch (Team Brave, 2018). "

        \ BAT supply. One buyer even managed to secure a $4.7 million worth of Basic\
