  introduction: Synthetix is a crypto-backed synthetic asset platform that provides
    on-chain exposure to real-world currencies, commodities, stocks, and indices.
  technology: Our synthetic assets (Synths) are backed by Synthetix Network Tokens
    (SNX) locked into a smart contract as collateral. Synths track the prices of real-world
    assets, allowing crypto-native or unbanked individuals to access the values of
    non-crypto assets. They can be used as stable mediums of exchange or traded at
    Synthetix Exchange.
  future: All Synth trades and transfers generate fees, which are distributed to SNX
    holders as reward for providing collateral..

whitepaper:
  abstract: "Havven will be a decentralised payment network where users transact directly\
    \ in a\r\nprice-stable cryptocurrency. Those who use the stablecoin pay fees to\
    \ those who\r\ncollateralise the network, compensating them for the risks of providing\
    \ collateral\r\nand stability. Collateral providers control the money supply,\
    \ and fees are\r\ndistributed in proportion with each individual\u2019s stabilisation\
    \ performance. Thus,\r\nHavven rewards suppliers of stability and charges those\
    \ who demand it."
