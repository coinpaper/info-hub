  one_sentence: Create smart contracts with javascript
  introduction: Lisk is a next generation platform that allows for the development
    and distribution of JavaScript based decentralized applications using an easy
    to use, fully featured ecosystem.
  technology: Through Lisk, developers can build, publish, distribute, and monetize
    their applications within a custom built cryptocurrency powered system that utilizes
    custom blockchains, smart contracts, cloud storage, and computing nodes; all from
    within one industry solution. Lisk is the first decentralized application solution
    written entirely in Node.js. This opens up the Lisk ecosystem to thousands of
    current developers with no additional skills necessary.
  future: Any web developer who is already familiar with JavaScript and Node.js can
    immediately jump in and begin building decentralized applications from day one..

    position: Vice President & CTO
    description: The global financial crisis helped to make Oliver realize that he
      wanted to create something of bigger significance than the projects he was involved
      in at the time. With twelve years of development experience, he understood that
      digital technology, put into the hands of more people than the elite, can be
      a powerful tool to make the world more just and honest. Oliver saw that blockchain
      technology offered great opportunity, but that the platforms available for developers
      were far too complex

      It is difficult to say whether or not this contributed to his drive to bring

      Decentralization through blockchain will help to better distribute and allocate
      funding so that it is evenly spread out and accessible to more people.

    description: From the early days of his career as a developer, Ali realized the
      incredible benefits that open source frameworks and libraries can bring to the
      world. He personally benefitted from these advantages, but never had the chance
      to pass them onto his community. Here at Lisk, he finally has the ability to
      contribute, as the Lisk platform encourages people to work together to build
      a better, decentralized world.
