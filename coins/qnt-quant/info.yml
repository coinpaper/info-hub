  one_sentence: Bridge between blockchains and other networks
  introduction: "What is Overledger?. Overledger is the world\u2019s first blockchain\
    \ operating system (OS) that not only connects blockchains to one another but\
    \ also connects existing networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of\
    \ internet scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as MApps. What does\
    \ it address?. Overledger will address the major limitations of current blockchain\
    \ technology and unlock its true potential. Overledger has the ability to unlock\
    \ and distribute value and applications across current and future blockchains.\
    \ Overledger is an agnostic platform that connects the world\u2019s networks to\
    \ blockchains and ensures you\u2019re not limited to any single vendor or technology."
  technology: "Who can take advantage of Overledger?. Enterprise and business:. Overledger\
    \ empowers businesses with the flexibility to connect their network to blockchains\
    \ without burden of being locked into an existing technology or vendor. By facilitating\
    \ multi-chain interoperability, Overledger will enable businesses to access new\
    \ markets, increase resilience, and de-risk investments. Individuals:. Facilitate\
    \ human-to-human and machine-to-machine trust that ensures safe and secure transactions\
    \ with one another. Provide individuals with a level of access and control of\
    \ their personal information we\u2019ve never experienced before. Governments:."
  future: "Deliver solutions for governments that minimise the bureaucracy but enhance\
    \ transparency and collaboration between governments, business and citizens. Provide\
    \ the opportunity for collaboration between the public and private sectors that\
    \ were never thought possible. Developers:. Give developers the ability to unlock\
    \ and distribute value and applications across current and future blockchains\
    \ and build their own unique Multi-Chain Applications. Overledger is not another\
    \ blockchain. It\u2019s the \u2018over ledger\u2019 that sits on top of blockchains\
    \ providing a meta-gateway.."
