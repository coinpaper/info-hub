      description: "Huobi Token is a very recent entrant of the crypto-world as it\
        \ was introduced into the market in January 2018. Since then, the coin has\
        \ garnered positive developments and not much has happened in its short life\
        \ span. Huobi token was initially launched as a loyalty-building token for\
        \ the Huobi exchange. Since China\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency in 2017, the\
        \ markets experienced very low user activity and the future of cryptocurrency\
        \ was being questioned. In order to combat this issue, Huobi launched the\
        \ token to gain user attention and give new life to the crypto-exchange. The\
        \ token rewards its users with lowered transaction fees and also serves as\
        \ an investment tool by being tradable with other cryptocurrencies as well\
        \ (Garner, 2018).<br />\r\nHuobi Token was distributed among Huobi Pro members\
        \ in its initial distribution phase. 60% of the total Huobi Token supply was\
        \ offered in the 15-day long runs that spanned from January 24 to February\
        \ 7, 2018. 20% of the supply was reserved for user rewards and platform operations\
        \ while 20% is retained for the team working on the project. The results of\
        \ launching a token of its own were very welcoming for the Huobi Group. Leon\
        \ Li, the CEO of the company, released a public statement recently, citing\
        \ the figures of company\u2019s performance which showed that the user engagement\
        \ had really boosted after Huobi Token\u2019s launch. The trends also indicated\
        \ the revival of the company\u2019s diminishing popularity and better acknowledgements\
        \ of its product line (Kuhn, 2019).\t<br />\r\nStarting from April 2018, the\
        \ company has organized eight separate token burning events. What the company\
        \ does is that it buys back some of the circulating tokens and destroys them.\
        \ This helps in stabilizing the coin and also maximizes profit for the investors.\
        \ The investors also see a reason to hold the currency to maximize their returns.\
        \ Around 21,356,800Huobi Tokens (HT) of the circulating 310,318,300HT have\
        \ been destroyed by the exchange. Huobi Group has been involved in different\
        \ projects that might support the use of Huobi Token in the future. The year\
        \ 2020 will decide what other products Huobi Group reveals (Walters, 2018).<br\
