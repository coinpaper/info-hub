  one_sentence: Wrapped Bitcoin tokenises Bitcoin and brings it onto the Ethereum blockchain
  introduction: Wrapped Bitcoin is a way to lock up Bitcoin (BTC) in a smart contract on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. A smart contract can turn the BTC into an ERC20 token, which is the standard token type used on Ethereum.
  technology: The process of locking up the Bitcoin and turning it into an ERC20 token is known as "wrapping." Once the BTC is turned into an ERC20 token, it can be used in Ethereum’s rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. Traders can deposit wrapped Bitcoin into a yield aggregator and earn interest on their deposit, supply liquidity to Uniswap and earn a percentage of trading fees & deposit wrapped Bitcoin in MakerDAO and take out a collateralized loan.
  future: There are some benefits when you wrap Bitcoin. These advantages have helped creating a new sector in the blockchain industry.

whitepaper:
  abstract: With the rise in popularity of ERC20, digital tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem have emerged
    as an important asset class. These tokens have all the advantages that blockchains and
    Ethereum have to offer in terms of transparency in total number of coins, owners, minting, fast
    confirmation times, transactions details and smart contract execution.

  introduction:
    purpose:
      description: 'One amazing project that has been the focus of the deFi community lately is the Wrapped Bitcoin. 
      Wrapped Bitcoin, or WBTC, has been the most successful project in the deFi category in terms of market 
      capitalization, use in the sector, and community growth. The purpose behind Wrapped Bitcoin is very intriguing. 
      It is a protocol that aims to bring the whole Bitcoin infrastructure under the covers of Ethereum. This means 
      that users will be able to use Bitcoin while staying inside Ethereum’s ecosystem.'

    scandals_highlights:
      description: 'The project is very young now. It was launched in January 2019 as a collaborative effort between 
      multiple big players of the community. It is interesting to note that the majority of these organizations 
      belonged to deFi space and were aiming to use Bitcoin to increase liquidity on the Ethereum network. BitGo, 
      Compound, MakerDAO, Kyber, and Ren are some of the blockchain entities supporting the development of WBTC. 
      The reason to target Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency of all time, and a 
      majority of it is just sitting idly in cold wallet storage. By bringing a fraction of that idle cryptocurrency 
      into the natural market will boost the deFi economy and will prove to be fruitful in terms of better liquidity. 
      Wrapped Bitcoin has gained quite a name for itself. It has become a rising force in the deFi space. Crypto-enthusiast 
      who were particularly interested in Bitcoin is now pulled towards the world of deFi all because of WBTC. In October, 
      Coinbase announced that it is going to list WBTC on its exchange, Coinbase Pro. This is a very exciting development 
      for WBTC, as it is now being accepted and listed by many renowned trading exchanges.'

    product:
      description: 'WBTCs, as actual products are tokens based on ERC-20 standards. Each token is basically supported 
      by a Bitcoin in a 1:1 parity. WBTC is a way to integrate Bitcoin, and therefore other cryptocurrencies, to their 
      DeFi counterparts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
      Before WBTC, there was no way for Bitcoin holders to participate in the DeFi space, as it only supports ERC-20 tokens. 
      How things happened before was that users had to exchange their Bitcoin for Ethereum or any other ERC-20 token, and it
      required transferring their coins to and fro cryptocurrency trading exchanges and wallets. Altogether, it used to be an 
      arduous task, and the users then were not owning Bitcoin, they were holding Ethereum.
      WBTC has made this process easier and much quicker. The legging into Ethereum from Bitcoin does not require these many 
      steps and can be considered direct for an end-user.'

      partnerships along the way. First of all, it is being developed under the collaboration of many cryptocurrency 
      giants like BitGo, Compound, MakerDAO, Kyber, and Ren. Many cryptocurrency trading exchanges have also listed 
      WBTC on their exchange lists in the previous year. Among these are Coinbase Pro, Binance, Bittrex, OKEx, etc. 
      In September, WBTC entered into a partnership with TRON cryptocurrency as well. BitGo, one of the developers of WBTC, 
      plans to launch the token on the TRON blockchain as well. This will take WBTC to new heights as it will capture another 
      cryptocurrency network other than Ethereum.'

      most sought after utility.'
