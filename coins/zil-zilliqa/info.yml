  one_sentence: Global transactions with low fees
  introduction: Zilliqa is a new public blockchain platform for high-throughput applications.
    It brings the theory of sharding to practice with its novel protocol that increases
    transaction rates as its network expands. The latest experimental results demonstrate
    a throughput of more than 2,800 transactions per second, which is over 200 times
    higher than that of today's popular blockchains. In addition to its scalability,
    Zilliqa provides a secure and efficient smart contract language called Scilla
    to enable security-by-design smart contract programming and verification. The
    Zilliqa blockchain platform is tailored towards enabling high-throughput data-driven
    decentralized apps, designed to meet the scaling requirements of applications
    in areas such as digital marketing, payment, shared economy and rights management.
    Zilliqa is backed by a team of tech entrepreneurs, academics, senior engineers,
    venture capitalists, and more.
  technology: "The underlying technology has been first incubated in a research lab\
    \ at the National University of Singapore, and then developed for commercial trials,\
    \ before being applied to Zilliqa\u2019s public blockchain platform. - Roadmap:.\
    \    + 31st Jan 2019: Mainnet Launch.    + Q1, 2019: Token Swap, Anchor Dapps.\
    \    + Q2, 2019: Zilliqa core protocol enhancements .    + Q3, 2019: Core protocol\
    \ refactoring, Scilla enhancements .    + Q4, 2019: Support for higher-level languages.\
    \ Latest news  Zilliqa and MaiCoin have teamed up with investment platform Fundnel\
    \ to create a private investment exchange Hg Exchange in Singapore."
  future: "Hg Exchange will be the first \u201Cmember-driven exchange\u201D in Southeast\
    \ Asia and unites leading financial intermediaries and emerging technology innovators\
    \ in a collaborative industry effort to underpin the issuance and trading of private\
    \ company shares. The exchange is an alliance of leading capital market intermediaries.\
    \ Hg Exchange has signed a memorandum of intent with Phillip Securities, PrimePartners,.\
    \ RHT Capital and Fundnel, which thereafter will become the first four members\
