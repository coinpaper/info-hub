  introduction: OmiseGO is building a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism,
    clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. OmiseGO
    is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed network
    of validators which enforce behavior of all participants.
  technology: It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to create a proof-of-stake
    blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants. This
    high-performant distributed network enforces exchange across asset classes, from
    . at-backed issuers to fully decentralized blockchain tokens (ERC-20 style and
    native cryptocurrencies). Unlike nearly all other decentralized exchange platforms,
    this allows for the decentralized exchange of other blockchains and between multiple
    blockchains directly without a trusted gateway token.
  future: Markets may be able to signi. cantly reduce spreads and encourage market
    assurance via decentralizing custody and increased transparency of market activity.
    This is achieved using smart contracts, protocol tokens enforcing correct market
    behavior of order book matching, a new construction of Ethereum bonded external
    enforcement of clearinghouse activity and commitments to historical exchange data
    for use with Ethereum smart contracts.

      description: "Storming the market to compete with the other altcoins, OmiseGO\
        \ comes with the aim of becoming an exchange, asset-backed blockchain and\
        \ most importantly a decentralized bank that could be used to make payments\
        \ to anyone anywhere around the world. The network gives you the freedom to\
        \ work with both cryptocurrencies and fiat (USD, EUR \u2026) currencies as\
        \ well. The marketing strategy of OmiseGo targets people who are not already\
        \ using banks for transaction, and their focus areas include, India, Japan,\
        \ and China.<br />\r\nOmiseGo defines its goal as trying to become a \u2018\
        \u2019preeminent high-value exchange and a settlement platform\u2019\u2019\
        . The purpose behind its advent was to build a user-friendly platform that\
        \ could connect different methods of payment, be it in the form of some cryptocurrency\
        \ or any fiat currency. Now, this vision is not something new and has been\
        \ expressed by many crypto-technologies before. OmiseGo takes the lead with\
        \ its new technology called Minimal Viable Plasma, which is built upon the\
        \ Ethereum Network. This technology aims to multiply the available throughput\
        \ of transactions per second (Poon, 2017). "

      description: "OmiseGo has remained an unpopular coin for a long time largely\
        \ because of its not-so-impressive marketing strategy. It has not been around\
        \ much in the news and no major scandal has hit the coin, whether good or\
        \ bad. The main setback that the project is facing is that the Plasma Network\
        \ has not yet been developed. Timely development and execution of the plasma\
        \ network will likely be a future project. Lately, rumours have been circulating\
        \ in the market that OmiseGo has appointed a new CEO because the former CEO\
        \ couldn\u2019t meet up with deadlines and delivery of the important projects.\
        \ The new CEO has been identified as Vansa, but there is no information available\
        \ to the public concerning her. <br />\r\nThe technology has been developed\
        \ under the advisory supervision of Vitalik, the founder of Ethereum. People\
        \ are hopeful about the technology partly due to his involvement in its development\
        \ (Pandorasbox, 2017). "
