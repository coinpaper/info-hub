  one_sentence: Anonymous, untraceable transactions
  introduction: "General Data and Information. Monero (XMR, formerly BitMonero) is\
    \ a fork of Bytecoin (on 18th April 2014) that emphasises the obfuscation of private\
    \ data (like addresses and transaction values) making for a blockchain with a\
    \ public ledger with open access for broadcasting and writing transactions but\
    \ with complete privacy for users. Each user can read the portions of the blockchain\
    \ that relate directly to their own addresses, or can choose to broadcast unobfuscated\
    \ transactions. The rationale behind the emphasis on privacy is the principle\
    \ that no outside observer should have the unrestricted right to view a user\u2019\
    s private financial transactions and net worth. This holds true for the current\
    \ financial system, and Monero aims to recreate this right to privacy in the crypto-currency\
    \ ecosystem. This privacy is achieved through a combination of enforced privacy,\
    \ bulletproof zero-knowledge proofs, ring confidential transactions, stealth addresses,\
    \ ring signatures and ASIC resistance. Milestones."
  technology: 18th April 2014 - Monero blockchain launched. 10th January 2017 - Confidential
    Transactions and Ring Signatures adopted, known collectively as Ring Confidential
    Transactions (RingCT). October 2018 - Bulletproofs (zero knowledge proofs) adopted
    on chain. Utility. Monero (XMR) aims to be fiat currency replacement, a store
    of value. By implementing privacy features by default, it restores the right to
    privacy of a user whilst being able to utilize and harness the strengths of a
    public blockchain, namely resilience, decentralization and censorship resistance.
    Due to the untraceability of transactions, all Monero coins are essentially fungible
    as no transaction history can be attached to them, thus making them functionally
    identical. Further developments include the ability to obfuscate IP addresses
    to further enhance privacy protections for users. Significant Features.
  future: 'Privacy coin, transaction addresses and amounts are obfuscated by design.
    Privacy of transactions mimics the use of cash in current economies. Monero is
    fungible, past transactions can not be traced, thus all coins are indistinguishable
    from other coins. Open and unrestricted access with no third party middleman for
    approving transactions. Transactions can be revealed by a user if required. Average
    blocktime of 2 minutes; Total supply of 18.4 million XMR (then 0.3 XMR per minute
    forever); Consensus via Proof of Work (CryptoNight). References: ..'

      description: "Although the world of cryptocurrency is growing daily and a lot\
        \ of crypto coins are flooding the market each passing day, not many people\
        \ are aware of the limitations battling crypto-giants like Bitcoin. Scalability,\
        \ network speed, transaction limits, fee charges are just a few issues to\
        \ name. Another disturbing issue that needs to be addressed is the issue of\
        \ privacy as it concerns users and their transactions. When a user pays for\
        \ a cup of coffee with Bitcoin, their wallet address is exposed to the seller\
        \ whether they want that information exposed or not. This allows him to know\
        \ the account details and transaction history of the user, which in fact,\
        \ is quite worrisome. <br />\r\nFor this very same reason, Monero was developed\
        \ with the vision of making transactions completely anonymous. Monero restricts\
        \ the visibility of user account details and the transaction history linked\
        \ with the account, until and unless the owner grants you access to the concerned\
        \ information (Saberhagen, 2013).<br />\r\n"

      description: "Monero has been in the news for quite sometimes, but sadly, they\
        \ are mostly jumping from one scandal to another. In May 2017, Riccardo Spagni\
        \ released a false announcement that something \u2018really big\u2019 was\
        \ going to come after the next team meeting. Monero\u2019s price skyrocketed\
        \ to almost double its valuation in anticipation of the news. However, a few\
        \ hours before the team meeting, he stated that he had only put out the news\
        \ to provoke speculators and no serious ambitions were behind the news and\
        \ this plummeted the price instantly to its old price in a matter of minutes\
        \ (Southurst, 2017).<br />\r\nSince Monero transactions can be anonymous,\
        \ it has been used in several unethical acts. In January 2019, the wife of\
        \ a Norwegian multi-millionaire was kidnapped, and the kidnappers demanded\
        \ $10 million in ransom through Monero tokens (Agency Staff, 2019). <br />\r\
        \nAnother incident was with \u2018The Wall Street Market\u2019, which was\
        \ an illegal platform for drugs, stolen data, and fake documents. The platform\
        \ was put down by German Federal Criminal Police and it was revealed that\
        \ a whopping amount of $600,000 worth of Monero was seized (Canellis, 2019).<br\
        \ />\r\nPositive developments for Monero have been very few over the years.\
        \ One of the important ones is that in 2018, many blockbuster stars like Mariah\
        \ Carey, Sia, Backstreet Boys, and 42 others started accepting payments in\
        \ form of Monero. However, this development was very short-lived and limited\

      description: 'The code used to develop Monero is maintained and updated by a
        team of developers. Their development history on the project can be traced
        back to their GitHub repository. An interesting development from their side
        is that they are adamant to make Monero resistant to centralization. Monero,
        like other cryptocurrencies, relies on mining. Many miners and big companies
        have invested heavily in mining machines knows as Application Specific Integrated
        Circuits (ASIC) and indirectly are in hold of the backend processing of cryptocurrencies.
        Monero is trying to make its network ASIC resistant, and are working on a
        new algorithm for that matter. This will provide better decentralization to
        the Monero network. '
