  introduction: Ethereum Classic is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed
    computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It provides
    a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes.
    Ethereum Classic also provides a value token called "classic ether", which can
    be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet and is
    used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed. The classic ether
    token is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges under the ticker symbol ETC. Gas,
    an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to prevent spam on the network
    and allocate resources proportionally to the incentive offered by the request.
  technology: 'The Ethereum platform has been forked into two versions: "Ethereum
    Classic" (ETC) and "Ethereum" (ETH). Prior to the fork, the token had been called
    Ethereum. After the fork, the new tokens kept the name Ethereum (ETH), and the
    old tokens were renamed Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum Classic appeared as a
    result of a disagreement with the Ethereum Foundation regarding The DAO Hard Fork.
    It united members of the Ethereum community who rejected the hard fork on philosophical
    grounds.'
  future: Users that owned ETH before the DAO hard fork (block 1920000) own an equal
    amount of ETC after the fork. Ethereum Classic passed a technical hard fork to
    adjust the internal prices for various opcodes of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM) on October 25, 2016, similar to the hard fork committed by Ethereum a week
    previously. The purpose of the hard fork was a more rational distribution of payments
    for resource-intensive calculations, which led to the elimination of the favorable
    conditions for attacks that were previously conducted on ETH and ETC. A hard fork
    held at the beginning of 2017 successfully delayed the "bomb complexity" that
    was added to the Ethereum code in September 2015 with a view of exponentially
    increasing the complexity of mining and the process of calculation of new network
    units. In late 2017, a hard fork occurred which changed the monetary policy with
    unlimited emissions to a system similar to Bitcoin..
