  one_sentence: Platform for decentralized apps and smart contracts
  introduction: "General Data and Information. The Ethereum white paper was released\
   \ by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 after proposals to include a scripting language\
   \ to enable decentralized applications (dApps) on the Bitcoin blockchain failed\
   \ to gain traction. Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain and\
   \ is used to compensate nodes for performing computations in the Turing-complete\
   \ instruction set of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). These instructions form\
   \ the backbone of smart contracts and digital asset ownership which are recorded\
   \ and issued upon the Ethereum blockchain."
  technology: "The development and governance of Ethereum\
   \ relies upon the use of open-source Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) whereby\
   \ developers and the wider public can submit proposals to improve or change standards\
   \ to the Ethereum platform. These proposals can affect all aspects of the Ethereum\
   \ ecosystem, from core code changes and ERC token standards through to public\
   \ informational resources."
  future: 'Significant Features. - Designed as a Virtual Machine with a Turing-complete
    language means that Ethereum is the Swiss Army tool of blockchains. Highly flexible
    and adaptable, but perhaps not always the most efficient solution. - A comparatively
    large hashrate makes Ethereum one of the more secure blockchains in existence.
    - Solutions to scaling problems are being investigated, including sharding and
    a move to Proof of Stake consensus protocol. These changes are slated to be released
    under the codename Casper.'

whitepaper:
  abstract: The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building
    decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe
    will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular
    emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely
    used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently
    interact, are important.
