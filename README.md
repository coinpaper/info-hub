# Coinpaper.io - Open Source Information

Welcome to the Coinpaper.io InfoHub. This repository is a collective effort to bring validated facts into the crypto world. 

All information on [coinpaper.io](https://coinpaper.io) has one of two sources:
- Numerical Data-Source (Github API, Reddit API, Coinpaprika API, ...)
- Text Research (Official Website, Documentation, Wiki, News Articles, ...)

While numeric data sources always bring us hard-truth like "number of commits on github", the text research
part is more subjective and may get outdated quickly. 

Coinpaper.io does an excellent job in fetching numeric data from different APIs to bring beautiful statistics to you. 
Most of this data ends up as part of the "Auto Score".
Further, we spend a lot of time and energy into doing research for coins and aggregate information into the
"Coinpaper Score". For all our research, we follow an academic approach and cite our sourced to be as transparent as possible.
However, we are not perfect. Maybe we have overlooked an important aspect or weighted a fact way too much. Or even worse, something
that might have been true a few months ago when our research was done might not be true to this date. 

To combat these issues, we decided to open-source all of our research in this GitHub repository and let everybody in the world discuss
and contribute to the displayed information. 
Anybody has the right to open issues to discuss a certain topic, request a change of information or even do the fundamental research
and add a completely new coin. 

However, to ensure that the quality remains high, we have a few guidelines to which anybody should stick:

## Citation is key

The correctness of every information altered, added or deleted must be proved with a reliable source. Change requests without an appropriate
source (like Reddit) will most probably be deleted.

## Stick to the facts

This is not a place for shills or rants. Stay factual about a coin, even if you don't like it or if it seems like an obvious scam to you.

## Stay polite

If you want to discuss a piece of information, stay polite and cite reliable sources to prove your argumentation.
